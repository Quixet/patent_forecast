When considering recent 
IV. EXAMPLES
The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit, the claimed invention.
A total of 92 subjects were included in clinical trials designed to evaluate the feasibility of the described method for determining recent 
One of the first endpoints investigated during clinical development of the recent use test method was whether there is any relationship between blood Δ
As part of the inclusion criteria for this clinical study, all subjects were instructed to abstain from the use of 
This Example reinforces the fact that a single measure of Δ
The window of impairment following 


This Example demonstrates that the window of impairment is approximately three hours after smoking 
Horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) was assessed in 44 subjects. Nystagmus, both horizontal and vertical, refers to the involuntary jerking of the eyes as they gaze up or down. Someone experiencing nystagmus is unaware of its occurrence. Horizontal gaze nystagmus was evaluated prior to smoking 
This Example demonstrates that horizontal gaze nystagmus is an effective physical indicator of impairment following 
Blood samples were collected from a total of 92 subjects involved in 


Based on these eight recent use parameters, all 92 subjects were evaluated for recent use prior to smoking (baseline), up to three hours post-smoking, and beyond three hours post-smoking. The results showed that at baseline prior to smoking, 37 out of 37 evaluable subjects (100%) had a negative test result. After smoking, 81 out of 83 evaluable subjects (97.6%) tested positive within the impairment window (up to three hours post-smoking). The two subjects who tested negative based on blood evidence alone were found to be positive based on breath evidence (see Example 5). Outside of the impairment window (>3 hours after smoking), 12 out of 61 evaluable subjects (19.7%) tested positive.
At baseline prior to smoking, all five cannabinoids and Δ
This Example shows that the test method based on blood alone is very effective in identifying recent 
The positive recent use test results outside of the three-hour impairment window based on blood sampling alone led to the incorporation of a second testing matrix, exhaled breath, to strengthen the results of the test method so that 
Out of a total of 34 evaluable subjects, 23 (67.6%) had detectable Δ


Table 3 above shows the percent positivity of six cannabinoids prior to smoking, within the first hour post-smoking during peak impairment, and more than one hour post-smoking in subjects' exhaled breath samples. In particular, CBN, CBG, and Δ


After analyzing the breath samples from all 44 subjects, 11 pharmacologic parameters were found to be associated with recent 


Within the first hour after smoking, which is the period of peak impairment, all 44 subjects (100%) were breath test positive, meaning they all exhibited a short Δ
We hypothesized that the incorporation of both exhaled breath and blood into a comprehensive recent 
Within the first hour after smoking, the period of peak impairment, all 44 subjects (100%) were breath and blood test positive, meaning they all exhibited a breath/blood Δ
In some instances, only a single breath and blood sample are needed due to the over-whelming evidence of recent 
In the exhaled breath study, all 44 subjects self-reported peak impairment within the first 20 minutes after smoking (see Table 1), which coincided with the shortest cannabinoid half-lives (Table 5) and peak incidence of horizontal gaze nystagmus (
Evidence of recent 


This Example demonstrated that the test method based on a combination of exhaled breath and blood sampling was 100% effective in identifying recent 
In the 
The data in Table 3 above shows that these six cannabinoids are predominantly present in exhaled breath within the peak impairment window. Critically, two of these cannabinoids, CBC and Δ
The results from these six examples demonstrate that the described test method based on exhaled breath and blood sampling, or on exhaled breath sampling alone, can accurately determine whether a subject has used 
While the comprehensive breath and blood test is limited to detecting recent

A MULTI-USERS MEDICAL CANNABIS DISPENSER,17275214,2021-03-11,Utility,Patented Case,2024-11-27,AHARON EYAL,US20220040421A1,2022-02-10,12168093.0,2024-12-17,,,,,Y,"DAHER, KIRA B",3785,BUZZELET DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGIES LTD.,4937,24505.0,3025-US,Small,"The field of art to which this invention generally pertains is medical use of cannabis, and specifically to a cannabis dispenser for use by multiple users.
One of the main alternatives to smoking as a method of administration is the use of vaporizers, which have the advantage of rapidly providing beneficial effects without the health challenges and problems associated with smoking. Vaporizers have been known for many years, and a variety of devices are currently commercially available. Yet, the majority of users still prefer smoking, suggesting that the available vaporizers do not accomplish the desired objectives.
A disadvantage of vaporizers is the need for sophisticated and expensive versions of the apparatus for well-controlled medical treatment and for high yield of cannabis utilization. Another challenge is related to the complexity of operating such sophisticated equipment, particularly in the case of children, elderly and handicapped or sick patients. Hospitals and nursing homes treating multiple cannabis users face additional difficulties related to the need to store a relatively large amount of cannabis serving s of different compositions, doze size and delivery method. Other difficulties are related to the need for tailoring the serving properties to the particular need of the various patients and other challenges faced by the caregivers.

Cannabinoids found in their natural state typically are in a non-decarboxylated form. Cannabinoids can be converted into a decarboxylated form by a process referred to as decarboxylation. Decarboxylation is a chemical reaction that removes the carboxyl group from a compound. In the case of cannabinoids, decarboxylation involves removing the carboxyl group from the cannabinoid compounds. One common technique for performing decarboxylation is by heating

For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the present invention is not unnecessarily obscured. Reference is now made to 
Reference is now made to 
The flower is the part of the female cannabis plant that typically has the highest concentration of THC, making it the ideal part of the plant for recreational consumption.
Flowers grow toward the top of the plant and they are commonly referred to as buds.
The cola is the mass of clustered flowers at the top of the cannabis plant.
Trichomes are the tiny resin glands on the flower's leaves and calyces. With the naked eye, they simply look like crystals; under a macroscopic lens, they can look like crystallized mushrooms. Trichomes evolved to protect the cannabis plant from insects and they typically have higher concentrations of THC. Because hashish is made from the resin heads of trichomes, certain strains of cannabis are specifically bred for their high trichome production.
The calyx is a floral structure that forms when the flower begins the budding process; it looks like a tubular sheath surrounding the ovule and pistils. It is composed of sepals, individual plant segments that are often green and occasionally fuzzy. The calyx's trichomes form with their heads pointing toward the top of the calyx.
Pistils are the pollen-catching hairs that extend from the calyx. They can be red, orange or brown in color. They are not known for containing high levels of THC.
The sugar leaf is a small leaf that grows within the flower and it is usually covered in trichomes because of its positioning. Sugar leaves are typically trimmed when flowers are harvested, but their trichome-coating makes them an ideal ingredient when making cannabis edibles.
The cannabis seed is hidden within a flower's calyx. Besides planting a seed to grow a cannabis plant, oil can be extracted from a cannabis seed to be used in human food or animal feed.
The Stems provide the structural support for flowers, while also storing and transporting nutrients for them. Stems aren't known for containing high levels THC, but they can be repurposed for their fiber.
The stalk is the central stem of a plant. As it lacks high levels of THC, it can also be repurposed for its fiber.
The node is the joint where a leaf branches off from the stalk.
The fan leaf is the large leaf that has the photosynthetic responsibility for the cannabis plant. It uses energy from the sun to create chemical energy to feed the plant. Fan leaves lack significant levels of THC, but they have become the unofficial symbol of cannabis.

Reference is herein made to steps of combining said storable intermediates of different plant parts, whole plants and/or plant varieties in order to provide a desired composition for use in a predetermined delivery form. The predetermined delivery form is selected according to intended use of the final cannabis product, mode of delivery of the final cannabis product, treatment indication for the final cannabis product, THC:CBD ratio or other cannabinoid components and/or terpenes and terpenoid components of the aforementioned first extracts of the final cannabis product.
In the present invention reference is made to first extracts, which may be cannabis concentrates, commonly referred to as cannabis extracts. These are significantly more potent than standard cannabis buds. Their applications as medicine have proven to be effective for patients suffering from all sorts of ailments. When made properly, a cannabis concentrate is reminiscent of the cannabis strain it was extracted from; the smell, taste, and effects are simply magnified due to a larger concentration by weight. Widely used extraction methods are described below in a non-limiting manner.
a. Kief
Kief is the simplest of concentrates. Kief is composed of the trichomes (the crystalline structures coating the outside surface of the flowers) broken away from the dried plant material, usually via specialized filtering screens. Kief is generally considered a lower-quality extract, but some top-flight extractors can produce an extremely clean and flavorful product using the dry sieve method. THC content can range from 20 percent to 60 percent.
b. Dry Sieve (Dry Sift)
A popular form of non-solvent hash is dry sieve (sometimes referred to as “dry sift”). Dry sieve is a refined version of kief that has been run through a series of screens so that only the trichome heads remain. The level of quality is often determined by amount of plant matter and capitulate trichome stalks found in the final product. This process at its highest level yields nothing but the largest, most perfect trichome gland heads and none of the gland stems, plant matter, etc. that generally clouds the quicker, lower-quality kief extractions. The most pure dry sieve hash should melt completely when exposed to heat, known as full-melt dry sieve hash.
c. Hash
Ice water extraction is one of the most common processes used to create quality non-solvent hash. The main goal and fundamental idea behind the ice water extraction process is to isolate the trichome heads, which house the essential oils of cannabis, from the stalks and plant matter.
The quality of the resulting hash is often determined by the size of the isolated trichome heads and the extent to which it melts when heated (full-melt being the best). The most important part of the ice water extraction process is drying the final product.
The powdery kief that coats cannabis flowers can be collected and pressed together to form hash. Additionally solvents like ice water or ethanol may be used to more effectively strip the cannabis plant of its cannabinoid-loaded trichomes.
d. Butane Hash Oil (BHO)
Butane Hash Oil, commonly referred to as BHO, is a type of cannabis concentrate made using butane as the main solvent. While a number of variables can determine the final consistency of BHO (mostly temperature), different names when referring to each of the different consistencies of BHO have been applied. Shatter for instance, refers to the glass-like consistency that often snaps or “shatters” when handled. Budder, honeycomb, crumble, and sap are also used to describe the different textures, though they all fall under the category of BHO.
Under this form of extraction, THC content can be as high as 80-90%. This makes BHO a popular choice for many medical marijuana patients suffering from chronic pain, sleep disorders, and other intractable symptoms.
e. Supercritical CO2 Oil
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a supercritical fluid, meaning it converts into a liquid form when pressurized. At the same time, CO2 is a pure chemical substance that occurs naturally and leaves behind no residues. In fact, supercritical CO2 extraction is already a standard extraction method for the food, dry cleaning and herbal supplement industries. It is a common food additive as well.
The CO2 extraction process allows compounds to be extracted with low toxicity, it utilizes a high pressure vessel containing cannabis. Supercritical CO2 is inserted into the vessel and pumped through a filter where it is separated from the plant matter once the pressure is released. Next, the supercritical CO2 evaporates and is dissolved into the cannabinoids.
f. Rick Simpson Oil (RSO)
Also known as cannabis oil, hemp oil, Phoenix Tears, and Rick Simpson Oil (RSO), whole-plant cannabis oil can be orally administered or applied directly to the skin. Sublingual delivery is the preferred method of treatment for many cancer patients. Not only is it a convenient way to medicate, but intake through the oral mucosal membranes in the mouth provides for rapid and effective absorption directly into the systemic circulation because of the increased bioavailability of the cannabinoids.
Exemplary RSO Small Scale Production Method
Place the completely dry material into a clean bucket.
Dampen the material with the solvent you are using. Many solvents can be used (although it is recommended that you avoid petroleum solvents). You can use ethanol, butane, 99% isopropyl alcohol, or even water. Two gallons of solvent is required to extract the THC from one pound, and 500 ml is enough for an ounce.
Crush the plant material using a stick of clean, untreated wood or any other similar device. Although the material will be damp, it will still be relatively easy to crush up because it is so dry.
Continue to crush the material with the stick, while adding solvent until the plant material is completely covered and soaked. Remain stirring the mixture for about three minutes. As you do this, the THC is dissolved off the material into the solvent.
Pour the solvent oil mixture off the plant material into another bucket. At this point you have stripped the material of about 80% of its THC.
Second wash: again add solvent to the mixture and work for another three minutes to extract the remaining THC.
Pour this solvent oil mix into the bucket containing the first mix that was previously poured out.
Discard the twice washed plant material.
Pour the solvent oil mixture through a coffee filter into a clean container.
Boil the solvent off: a rice cooker will boil the solvent off nicely, and will hold over a half gallon of solvent mixture. CAUTION: avoid stove-tops, red hot elements, sparks, cigarettes, and open flames as the fumes can be extremely flammable.
Add solvent to rice cooker until it is about % full and turn on HIGH heat. Make sure you are in a well-ventilated area and set up a fan to carry the solvent fumes away.
Continue to add mixture to cooker as solvent evaporates until you have added it all to the cooker.
As the level in the rice cooker decreases for the last time, add a few drops of water (about 10 drops of water for a pound of dry material). This will help to release the solvent residue, and protect the oil from too much heat.
When there is about one inch of solvent-water mixture in the rice cooker, swirl the contents until the solvent has finished boiling off.
When the solvent has been boiled off, turn the cooker to LOW heat. At no point should the oil ever reach over 290° F. or 140° C.
Remove the pot containing the oil from the rice cooker. Gently pour the oil into a stainless steel container
Place the stainless steel container in a dehydrator, or put it on a gentle heating device such as a coffee warmer. It may take a few hours but the water and volatile terpenes will be evaporated from the oil. When there is no longer any surface activity on the oil, it is ready for use.
Suck the oil up in a plastic syringe, or in any other container you see fit. A syringe will make the oil easy to dispense. When the oil cools completely it should have the consistency of thick grease.
g. Rosin
Rosin has been gaining a lot of traction in the medical cannabis community as of lately and for good reason. Rosin is a solid form of resin that is obtained by adding pressure & heat to vaporize volatile liquid terpenes, typically with an industrial heat press (or even a hair straightener for small batches).
The rosin technique is quick, simple and affordable, allowing anyone to create quality solventless hash in a matter of seconds. To get started making Rosin, you only need a few basic tools in order to create a quality finished product, but not nearly as many as you need with other extraction techniques.

The present disclosure relates to methods for the analysis and measurement of cannabis secondary compounds including cannabinoids and terpenes.
The requirements for an acceptable cannabis assay have changed dramatically over the years, and the reasons for this appear to be related to its unique status. The political and social climate has contributed to the changing requirements, and legality issues surrounding cannabis have made it difficult to obtain a full spectrum of reference standards and sample material for validation studies. The number of states considering legalization of cannabis, medical or otherwise, is growing rapidly and a number of entrepreneurs have opened facilities to keep up with demand for reliable testing and labeling, however the “grey-market” status of cannabis and rush to open these labs have resulted in a wide array of creative methodologies for analytical testing that have not been validated. While there may be a number of methods suitable for cannabis analysis, as more states are now considering medical cannabis it is even more crucial for labs to perform important assay validation. This systematic evaluation of the scope and limitations of an assay is critical to demonstrate the assay is fit for its intended purpose and is an absolute requirement for the confident use of any methodology.
The present invention addresses many of the shortcomings of the present methods for cannabis analysis, while providing robust and accurate analysis alternatives.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods for quantifying cannabinoids using ibuprofen, n-nonane, and 4-biphenyl carboxylic acid standards.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of extracting cannabinoids and terpenes using a bead beater.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of extracting cannabinoids and terpenes in an extraction solution with a solvent, wherein the solvent is ethanol.
In some embodiments, the present disclosure teaches a method for determining the concentration of at least one cannabinoid and/or at least one terpene in a sample of cannabis tissue, the method comprising: (a) homogenizing the sample of cannabis tissue in an amount of an extraction solution with a bead beater to obtain an analysis sample. (b) optionally diluting the analysis sample in a dilution solution; (c) subjecting the analysis sample to chromatographic separation and detecting the analysis sample with a detector; and (d) determining the concentration of at least one cannabinoid and/or at least one terpene in the sample of cannabis; wherein the extraction solution and the dilution solution each comprises a first internal standard with a known response ratio relative to the at least one cannabinoid in the detector, and a second internal standard with a known response ratio relative to the at least one terpene in the detector, and wherein the dilution solution further comprises a third standard with a known response ratio in the detector.
In any of the various embodiments disclosed herein for cannabinoid detection, the chromatographic separation can be high pressure liquid chromatography.
In some embodiments, the present disclosure teaches methods for determining the concentration of at least one cannabinoid and/or at least one terpene in a sample of cannabis tissue, wherein the moisture content of the cannabis sample is determined via FTIR.
Thus in some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods for determining the concentration of at least one cannabinoid and/or at least one terpene in a sample of cannabis tissue, wherein the dry weight of the cannabis sample is calculated by subtracting the FTIR moisture content from the cannabis sample.
In any of the various embodiments disclosed herein the chromatographic separation can be gas chromatography.

In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods which could be adopted as the federal or state standard among regulating agencies as a validated analytic method for cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis. The methods of the present invention could be used for any federal or state governmental purpose, including but not limited to enforcement (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration), compliance (e.g., U.S. Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Compliance) and/or therapeutic purposes (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration).
The scientific and technological discoveries surrounding cannabis have also contributed to the changing analytical landscape. Close to 500 chemical moieties have been identified in cannabis (1), and as research continues to shed light on the pharmacology of this array of secondary metabolites, assays have had to keep pace. Early assays focused on the pharmacologically active THC. Later endeavors focused on THC, CBD, and CBN, mainly as a manner to distinguish between drug-type and fiber-type cultivars. As the focus expanded to the plant itself (rather than just the content of the psychoactive THC in the finished flower) assays were needed to identity CBG and the naturally occurring acidic forms of all the cannabinoids, such as THCA, CBGA, and CBDA. As more studies added to the growing list of pharmacological effects of the cannabinoids, CBD(A) and THCV(A) being prime examples, the ability to assay for the “other” cannabinoids has become more important. Most recently attention has turned to the synergistic effects of the terpenes, thereby expanding the criteria for an acceptable assay to include the terpene family (2, 15, and PCT/US2014/030267).
Cannabis culture has also placed changing demands on analytical testing. Cultivators, connoisseurs, and patients have operated in an environment that has fostered an explosion of phenotypes and chemotypes. Indoor cultivation, hybridization practices, refined horticultural techniques, organoleptic preferences, therapeutic needs, and evolving cannabis products have created a situation that is far more complicated than a “single analyte and single matrix” condition that accompanies more phenotypically homogeneous crops. Laboratory oversight of cannabis production and maximized dialogue between cultivators and analysts is essential for proper sampling, statistical analysis, and quality control as cultivators become more educated and leverage technologies derived from traditional crop and plant science.
Due to these changing demands and the lack of a sufficiently validated method, we sought to develop a reliable and relatively high throughput assay that covered a broad range of analytes and concentrations. While there may be other methodologies appropriate for the analysis of cannabis, this work outlines practical procedures any lab should attempt before declaring an analytical assay suitable. The present invention outlines a practical analytical procedure that can be applied by both production model quality control and research oriented laboratories. The validation methods described herein should also be reviewed in detail by analytical labs providing services to the cannabis industry so they can ensure their methods are suited for the intended purpose.
Analyte Quantification
The present invention is based in part on the discovery of new methods for cannabis analyte quantification. In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of appropriate internal standards and validation techniques throughout the entire process. The present invention also teaches that the sample preparation procedure must allow for relatively high throughput and not be vulnerable to differences in sample morphology due to the large number of samples and diversity of phenotypes. We also sought to validate the method while keeping the practical aspects of this task in mind. A full validation for such a broad range of analytes and wide range of concentrations was extremely difficult. Therefore, we took an approach similar to Single Laboratory Validation. The assay performance must be acceptable and fully characterized.
While most cannabis testing labs lack rigorous evaluation of their analytical procedures, their experience with a myriad of real-world samples made it possible to understand the scope of an acceptable method. Similarly, a number of academic papers have been released over the years (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) that have presented validated assays for many cannabis analytes. However, very few have covered the desired repertoire of cannabis analytes. Furthermore, none of these methodologies were high throughput, and many never dealt with real-world samples or sample concentrations.
A recent emerging concept is that whole herbal cannabis has additional therapeutic benefits when compared to isolated THC. This has been attributed to the modulating and synergistic effects of the other cannabinoids and the terpenoids (2, 15, and PCT/US2014/030267). These two major classes of analytes are the most appealing at this time because of their combined pharmacological effects and organoleptic properties. The cannabinoids are biosynthesized in the plant as the acids, but most of the known pharmacology is a result of the neutral forms. Over 150 cannabinoids have been identified in the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia® (AHP), but THC(A), CBD(A), CBG(A), and THCV(A) are the most prevalent and the most biologically relevant at this time. There are over 200 terpenoids (1, 2, 7) in cannabis, but most are rarely seen in relevant quantities. After surveying the landscape with qualitative in-house assays across a broad range of cultivars, it was determined that the 17 terpenes analyzed in this work were the most commonly occurring, present in reasonable quantities, and had putative pharmacology (2, 4, 
Quantification of Cannabinoids
The two most common methods for analysis of cannabinoids are Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography with a UV detector (HPLC-UV) (7). While GC-FID has a wide linear range, the present invention teaches that the GC injector coverts all the acidic cannabinoids to their neutral counterparts by decarboxylation, thus the original composition of the plant cannot be determined. Furthermore, the present application teaches that that decarboxylation is not quantitative and is dependent on variables such as injector temperature and configuration (8). In some embodiments, the present application teaches that analyte concentration in the GC vial can also affect the efficiency of conversion. It is because of the aforementioned variability that HPLC has been established as the method most suited for cannabinoid analysis. Hazekamp developed, validated, and shared an HPLC method, however it did not resolve CBG from CBD or CBN from CBGA (3). The most promising HPLC method was first presented by DeBacker et al, and subsequently applied by Swift et al, and published by AHP (5, 6, 7). Apart from the loss of resolution of CBG and CBD at high concentrations (higher than levels naturally occurring in the plant) this provided a good starting point. Both of these methodologies documented a linear range of approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude and while this would require two dilutions for the full range of cannabinoid concentrations (approximately 0.1% to 40%), it is realistic for an HPLC-DAD method and was adopted as our target range.
Quantification of Terpenoids
Although HPLC is the method of choice for cannabinoids, the present invention teaches that GC is the method of choice for small volatile organics such as the terpenoids. The present inventors realized that the large linear range of FID detection makes it possible to cover the extremely wide range of terpene concentrations (approximately 0.01% to 1.5%) with a single injection.
Quantification of Cannabinoids and Terpenoids with FTIR.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of analyzing cannabinoid and terpene profiles using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR is a spectroscopy technique used to obtain the infrared spectrum of absorption, emission, photoconductivity, or Raman scattering of a substance. Unlike atomic absorption, IR spectroscopy examines vibrational transitions within a single electronic state of a molecule, and is not concerned with specific elements, such as Pb, Cu, etc. Such vibrations fall into one of three main categories, i.e., stretching, which results from a change in inter-atomic distance along the bond axis; bending, which results from a change in the angle between two bonds; and torsional coupling, which relates to a change in angle and separation distance between two groups of atoms. Almost all materials absorb IR radiation, except homonuclear diatomic molecules. e.g., O
IR range is sometimes further delineated by three regions having the wavelength and corresponding wavenumber ranges indicated:

For a molecule to absorb IR, the vibrations or rotations within the molecule must cause a net change in the dipole moment of the molecule. The alternating electric field of the incident IR radiation interacts with fluctuations in the dipole moment of the molecule and, if the frequency of the radiation matches the vibrational frequency of the molecule, then radiation will be absorbed, causing a reduction in the IR band intensity due to the molecular vibration.
Examples of functional groups and their respective energy bands include, for example, hydroxl (O—H) (3610-3640 cm
By knowing which wavelengths are absorbed by each functional group of interest, an appropriate wavelength can be directed at the sample being analyzed, and then the amount of energy absorbed by the sample can be measured. The intensity of the absorption is related to the concentration of the component.
In some embodiments, the advantage of FTIR analysis is that it does not require samples to be pre-dried to remove moisture. In some embodiments, the advantage of FTIR analysis is that tissue samples can be assayed without first extracting analytes. Thus for example, in some embodiments, the present invention teaches the analysis of cannabinoids and/or terpenes, directly on plant tissue. In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the analysis of whole plant tissue such as leaves or inflorescences. In other embodiments, the present invention teaches the analysis of finely ground plant tissue as described infra.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of using FTIR to replace traditional moisture content analyses of cannabis samples. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of correcting cannabinoid and terpene content measurements by the moisture content values obtain from FTIR analysis.
In other embodiments, the present invention teaches the analysis of cannabinoids and/or terpenes, of cannabis tissue samples, and/or extracts such as kief, hashish, bubble hash, solvent reduced oils, sludges, e-juice, and tinctures, among others.
Analytical Standards
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of an internal standard to improve the quality of results. The present invention teaches that an internal standard corrects for volume and/or analyte losses during sample processing, but only when added early in a process. The only methodology found that using an internal standard prior to sample processing was the AHP GC method (7). Among other characteristics, an acceptable internal standard must be easily available, stable, and have similar physicochemical properties to the analyte of interest. However, both AHP methods employ controlled substances (androstenedione and prazepam) and labs around California have been utilizing unstable (alpha-tocopherol) and chemically dissimilar (caffeine) standards. Clearly there was a need for more appropriately suited internal standards. The present invention presents a unique approach of employing three internal standards. Two of them are present in both the extraction solution and diluent solution and corrects for variation in terpene and cannabinoid content due to sample processing and extraction. These concentrations are unaffected by dilution and are used to generate the internal standard calibration curves. The third is only present in the extraction solution, and corrects for variability in cannabinoid content due to the dilution process (vide infra).
Extraction and Sample Preparation Methods
Solvent
The first step in any HPLC or GC—based chemical analysis is the extraction of cannabinoids and terpenes. A variety of methods for extracting samples are provided in the literature, and they vary in solvent type, solvent volume, sample mass, and extraction procedures. Both of the AHP methods recommended the use of methanol/chloroform as the solvent, however this generates a halogenated waste stream and methanol is one of the more difficult solvents to use with standard pipetting techniques.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of Ethanol as the extraction solvent. In some embodiments, ethanol, on the other hand, is easier to handle and a number of researchers have shown it is a suitable solvent for extracting cannabinoids and terpenes so is the solvent of choice for some embodiments of the present invention.
Sampling
Cannabis is an agricultural crop and this means inherent variability in analyte concentrations. Thus, proper sampling is critical. Only one method specified a bulk sample mass required to obtain representative results (3). While the recommended mass of 60 grams would undoubtedly reduce variability in testing different lots of material, this is too high a material demand for a host of reasons including associated cost. As a result, in lieu of being able to randomly sample the actual cultivation site, the present invention teaches in some embodiments a reduction the sample requirement to 5-7 grams.
Homogenizing
The approach of Hazekamp (3) was used to pre-homogenize the bulk samples and the finished flowers were ground to fine pieces in a stainless steel coffee grinder.
Moisture Correction and Chemical Desiccation
Traditionally, cannabinoid and terpene contents are presented in terms of % based on the dry weight of the sample. For example, a 1 gram dried sample of cannabis containing 10% THC and 1% terpenes would contain 100 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of terpene oil. In order to reduce the analysis error introduced by the variability in moisture content between cannabis samples, the AHP methods for cannabis analysis recommend drying said samples in a forced air oven prior to HPLC and GC analysis (7). This is the method currently employed by most cannabis analytical laboratories.
The present invention is based in part on the discovery that traditional cannabis analysis methods of oven drying samples are inaccurate because they often lead to the loss of terpenes, particularly that of headspace volatiles. Thus in some embodiments, the present invention teaches against the use of forced air oven drying.
Typical drying procedures, such as those recommended in the AHP monograph, involve an initial drying at for 3 days at 15-21 C until inflorescences lose 75% of their initial mass, followed by 1-2 weeks at 15-21 C in plastic bags following a “burping” procedure. When completely dried using this procedure, inflorescences are reported to contain approximately 10% moisture (AHP monograph). Determination of moisture content is typically done by heating 1.0 g of powdered cannabis in an oven at 105 C for 2 hours (7-AHP monograph).
The recommended procedure for drying and curing is too long for timely determination of secondary metabolite production during “time courses”, and the procedure for determining moisture content raises concerns due to the elevated temperature, which can drive off not only moisture but also volatile secondary metabolites produced by cannabis. This is especially true of cannabis, which contains not only green leaf volatiles but also high amounts of monoterpenes. The terpenes can reach levels of 2% by mass, and although boiling points are generally above 150 C, they do have vapor pressures and analyte loss can be observed at room temp. This process can be accelerated at elevated temperatures.
Cannabis also produces the cannabinoids as their acidic forms, and these forms undergo decarboxylation to provide the biologically active neutral forms. This process is much faster at elevated temperatures but also occurs spontaneously at room temp, and cannabis stored for long periods will show larger amounts of THC and CBD relative to THCA and CBDA. The loss of CO2 during this process can amount to significant loss of mass when the cannabinoids constitute as much as 20% by mass of inflorescences. For instance, the present disclosure teaches that 1.0 g of cannabis containing 20% of THCA can lose approximately 2.5% of its mass as CO2 upon heating due to decarboxylation to form THC.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches alternative methods of chemical drying of cannabis samples. Thus in some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of drying samples for cannabis analyte measurements with one or more chemical desiccants. A non-exhaustive list of the chemical desiccants suitable for the methods of the present invention include: Drierite® (calcium sulfate); DampRid® (calcium chloride crystals); a salt selected from the group consisting of alkali metal halides, alkaline earth metal halides, iron halides, and aluminum halides; silica gel, calcium sulfate, calcium fluoride, activated charcoal, molecular sieves, lithium chloride, cobalt chloride, among others. Other humidity-attracting substances useful for the methods of the present invention include: deliquescent compounds, deliquescent salts, hygroscopic compounds, hydrophilic compounds, hygroscopic salts, humectants, absorbents, adsorbents, dehumidifiers, phosphorous oxide, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, potassium acetate, bentonite, montmorillonite clay, molecular sieve, monohydric compounds, polyhydric compounds, and polysaccharides such as start and cellulose.
Thus in some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of drying cannabis samples prior to chemical analysis by placing in a sealed container with one or more chemical desiccants. In some embodiments, the present invention teaches grinding the same prior to drying. In other embodiments, whole cannabis tissues can be desiccated.
In some embodiments, the desiccation time of cannabis samples will depend on multiple factors including the air temperature and humidity, and moisture level of the sample. In some embodiments, the present invention teaches conducting chemical desiccation at room temperature. In other embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of conducting chemical desiccation at temperatures below 100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 91, 90, 89, 88, 87, 86, 85, 84, 83, 82, 81, 80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 degrees Celsius. In some embodiments, the present invention teaches conducting chemical desiccation at temperatures between 10 and 40 degrees Celsius.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches desiccation of samples until the samples reach substantially steady state mass levels. In some embodiments steady mass means a mass loss of less than 30%, 29%, 28%, 27%, 26%, 25%, 24%, 23%, 22%, 21%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% per day.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches chemical desiccation of cannabis samples for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, or 96 hours. In some embodiments, certain cannabis samples may require up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 or more days.

Extraction Efficiency
The literature presents a wide range of sample masses for extraction, ranging from 100-200 mg to 500-1000 mg (3, 4, 7). The larger mass is expected to give more representative results so a number of sample masses were evaluated. The literature also presents a wide range of volume/mass ratios for extraction of analytes ranging from 3 mL to 10 mL per 100 mg of sample (4, 7). In some embodiments, the present invention teaches methods of minimizing cost and waste, while also maximizing concentrations of terpenes by using optimal levels of solvent for cannabis analyte extraction. Thus in some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of 1 mL, 1.1 mL, 1.2 mL, 1.3 mL, 1.4 mL, 1.5 mL, 1.6 mL, 1.7 mL, 1.8 mL, 1.9 mL, 2 mL, 2.1 mL, 2.2 mL, 2.3 mL, 2.4 mL, 2.5 mL, 2.6 mL, 2.7 mL, 2.8 mL, 2.9 mL, 3 mL, 3.1 mL, 3.2 mL, 3.3 mL, 3.4 mL, 3.5 mL, 3.6 mL, 3.7 mL, 3.8 mL, 3.9 mL, 4 mL, 4.1 mL, 4.2 mL, 4.3 mL, 4.4 mL, 4.5 mL, 4.6 mL, 4.7 mL, 4.8 mL, 4.9 mL, 5 mL, 5.1 mL, 5.2 mL, 5.3 mL, 5.4 mL, 5.5 mL, 5.6 mL, 5.7 mL, 5.8 mL, 5.9 mL, 6 mL, 6.1 mL, 6.2 mL, 6.3 mL, 6.4 mL, 6.5 mL, 6.6 mL, 6.7 mL, 6.8 mL, 6.9 mL, 7 mL, 7.1 mL, 7.2 mL, 7.3 mL, 7.4 mL, 7.5 mL, 7.6 mL, 7.7 mL, 7.8 mL, 7.9 mL, 8 mL, 8.1 mL, 8.2 mL, 8.3 mL, 8.4 mL, 8.5 mL, 8.6 mL, 8.7 mL, 8.8 mL, 8.9 mL, 9 mL, 9.1 mL, 9.2 mL, 9.3 mL, 9.4 mL, 9.5 mL, 9.6 mL, 9.7 mL, 9.8 mL, 9.9 mL, or 10 mL, of solvent for every 100 mg of cannabis tissue.
Extraction of Analytes
In some embodiments, most of the analytes of interest reside in the easily disrupted trichomes of the cannabis plant. Procedures for extracting these analytes include passive extraction for 30 minutes (4), sonication for 30 minutes (5), and maceration for one hour followed by sonication for 30 minutes (7). Sonication has been one of the more popular methods for disruption and is very effective for small particles and trichomes. However, this process can be less efficient with solid samples or large particle sizes, such as bulk plant material (13). Sonication baths can improve throughput, however there is variability in power across the bath that depends on sample depth, placement, and number of samples in the bath (12, 13). Using a probe for disruption minimizes variability, but also decreased throughput while increasing the possibility for cross-contamination by the probe.
In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of high throughput homogenizers. In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of a wide range of grinding, extraction, and milling extraction methods (13). In some embodiments, the present invention teaches the use of a beadbeater homogenizer. In some embodiments the present invention teaches extraction without use of a sonicator. The Examples of the present specification evaluate the use of various homogenizing technologies for extracting cannabis samples, and compares them against the methods taught herein.
Method Validation
Method validation includes all of the procedures that demonstrate a particular method used for the quantitative analysis of analytes in a given matrix is reliable and reproducible. Fishedick et al, performed a very limited validation of their terpene assay by spiking in pinene, linalool, and caryophyllene at a single concentration and verifying acceptable recovery (4), however this did not include all the terpenes of interest nor did it cover the expected range of concentrations. Both Hazekamp and DeBacker et al. had reasonable approaches for validating the HPLC assays for cannabinoids, however they were incomplete (3, 5). Hazekamp used finished cannabis flowers and the method of standard addition to determine recoveries of THCA. THC, CBD, and CBN, however CBDA, CBGA, CBD, THCVA, and THCV were not evaluated. Furthermore, since standard addition was employed, analytes were only validated at and above the highest expected concentrations thus the lower quantitation levels remained uncharacterized. For instance THCA was only validated at concentrations of 19%, 22%, and 26% and CBD at concentrations of 6%, 7%, and 8%. DeBacker et al, was able to validate all of the major analytes of interest by spiking cannabis extract into nettle, however this covered narrow concentration ranges of 1.8%-6.1% for THCA, 1.0%-3.3% for CBDA, and 0.1%-0.4% for CBGA. None of these levels reflect those found in most samples in today's marketplace. The present invention teaches methods to validate all the major analytes of interest in ranges that were applicable to real world cannabis samples.
Evaluation of Calibration Curves
A relatively common practice by labs that are evaluating calibration curves is to simply let the instrument's software run a regression analysis without evaluating the data plot or the residuals. Typically, it is then assumed that a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 indicates the curve is linear and any deviation is simply due to dilution errors. While this may be true for detectors such as FID, it is a dangerous assumption when utilizing UV or MS detection. Furthermore, calibration solutions can give linear responses over two orders of magnitude with FID while the same solutions are linear to just over one order of magnitude with MS or UV detection.
Correlation is not a measure of linearity, and it is easy to generate data with apparently good correlation, but examination of the residuals may indicate the calibration is unfit for the intended calibration or desired concentration range. Simply relying on a correlation coefficient can be misleading and a linear regression over two orders of magnitude can provide a coefficient of 0.999 but still give >35% error at the low end when back calculating results, and this is not necessarily due to dilution error. While most determinations may be made at higher concentrations, the analyst needs to understand the implications of diluting to the lower and less accurate end of the curve. Spike recoveries at high, medium, and low concentrations that bracket the calibration curve would show this error, but many laboratories do not perform this step. Back calculating concentrations of standards from the calibration curve as a way of evaluating the residuals can serve as a leading indicator of the performance of spike recovery studies, and residuals with unacceptably high values or values indicating unacceptable trends suggest the calibration should be repeated and/or the linear range of the assay adjusted.
The present invention teaches methods which not only require a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99, but to also examine the residuals by back calculating the concentrations of each standard from the calibration curve to determine the error in order to evaluate the quality of the linear regression.
Sample Types
While the experimental results presented herein were carried out with flower samples, the present invention can also been applied to water hash, dry sift, kief, and a variety of extracts and shatters. This methodology is suitable as long as the extract does not form a biphasic mixture. Various oils, tinctures, butters, and baked goods have been found to present a biphasic mixture with the extraction solvent and the method cannot be applied to these matrices.
For non-homogeneous agricultural samples, such as flowers, a larger sample size improves reproducibility of measurements from lot to lot. In lieu of being able to sample the actual site, a 5-7 g “random” sample was ground in a stainless steel coffee grinder and a portion of this ground material was extracted.
Plant Variability
The apparent ease of obtaining and publishing analytical testing results has contributed to confusion when it comes to their interpretation. This confusion can arise from two sources, 1) a misunderstanding of the variability characteristic in an agricultural crop, and 2) loss of data integrity during the cultivation, testing, and reporting process.
Agricultural crops inherently have a large amount of natural variation resulting from differences in environmental conditions, genetic background, developmental stage, farming practices, and seasonal changes (17), which result in differences in organoleptic profile, appearance, nutrient composition, shelf life, and crop yield. This variation is important when considering nutritional value or other quality attributes of human food, however it becomes critical when the agricultural crop contains secondary metabolites that are used to treat medical conditions.
The synergistic effects of the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis provide its medicinal properties, thus determining the concentrations of both is paramount. In fact, both the chemical fingerprint as well as the potency of these compounds is of primary concern to human consumption (2, 15). The analytical method described herein has been employed not only to determine the chemotype of cannabis preparations destined for human consumption but also to gain a better understanding of the sources of variability associated with the production of cannabis in a state-of-the-art indoor production facility. In some embodiments, additional applications of the methods of the present invention include monitoring chemotype through developmental stages, evaluation of the impact of different environmental conditions and cultivation techniques, and selection of progeny for breeding purposes.
The present invention teaches optimized and validated methods for the analysis of terpenes and cannabinoids in cannabis that is amenable to relatively high throughput and provides accurate and reliable results. A single sample extraction procedure provides extract that can be analyzed for both terpenes and cannabinoids by GC-FID and HPLC-DAD, respectively.
Both the precision and accuracy of the method were found to be acceptable for all of the terpenes and cannabinoids analyzed and this was demonstrated by spike recoveries at analyte levels that reflect those found in most samples on the market today.
Both intra-day and inter-day precisions of the complete extraction and analysis were demonstrated on five different cultivars containing different cannabinoid and terpene profiles and exhibiting different flower morphologies, and in most cases the RSDs were lower than the PRSDs. While inter-day precision was not satisfactory for the volatile monoterpenes, this proved to be an artifact of the experimental design and highlighted the need for timely analysis of samples once trichomes are ruptured.
It has also been demonstrated that a high throughput homogenizer makes this method amenable to processing a large number of samples with good extraction efficiency and precision, unlike traditional sonication or passive extraction methods. This method is only minimally affected by sample morphology and has been found to be fairly robust from a process standpoint. The instrumental methods also perform reliably with this sample load.
Large sample sizes along with well-characterized analytical assays are the key to obtaining consistent and representative assay results.
Comparisons with other labs suggest many testing facilities do not perform even basic steps to verify the performance of the assays being used. In some cases, such as with missing terpenes or misidentified minor cannabinoids, this results in misleading information. In other cases, such as labeling a Chemotype I cultivar with a Chemotype II test result, this has the potential to cause serious misadventures for the medical or recreational consumer. It is also important to note that these results were not isolated incidents, and consistently poor performance was noted over almost two years.
These results highlight the critical need for complete laboratory integration into any proposed cannabis production facility. Under the current paradigm, analytical laboratories must take the samples provided for testing at face value and assume they are representative of the entire crop. Meanwhile, cultivators and patients must take analytical results at face value and assume they have been obtained with reliable methodologies. As demonstrated above, both of these assumptions can have an additive effect in the propagation of misinformation. A facility staffed with interacting cultivators, plant and crop scientists, and research scientists allows for proper interpretation of data and incorporation of reliable feedback loops required for an efficient production process. This integrated chain of custody leading from plant, to data, to information is also essential for building accurate knowledge cultivators, patients, and legislators can use.
Denatured ethanol, nonane, 4-biphenyl carboxylic acid, and ibuprofen were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The Certificates of Analyses for each lot were used determine the purity, and mass values were adjusted accordingly. Diluent was reagent grade ethanol. To prepare typical extraction solution, nonane, ibuprofen (IBU), and 4-biphenyl carboxylic acid (BPCA) were added to a volumetric flask, which was brought up to volume with reagent grade ethanol and stirred for 3 hours to give a solution that contained 0.1 mg/mL nonane, 0.2 mlg/mL IBU, and 2 mg/mL BPCA. The peak area of BPCA in new batches of extraction solution is verified to be within 2% of previous batches by diluting 1:6 and injecting on the HPLC in triplicate.
The dilution solution was prepared in a similar manner but BPCA was left out of the solution.
To prepare spike solution with both nonane and ibuprofen (IBU) as internal standards, each was added to a volumetric flask and it was brought up to volume with reagent grade ethanol to give a solution that contained 1.5 mg/mL nonane and 288 mg/mL IBU.
The terpenes were separated on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 680 GC fitted with an FID detector, an Elite 5MS column, and a Restek Precision SkyLiner. The injector temperature was set at 230° C., a 1.5 μL injection volume was used, and the split flow was set at 20:1. The carrier gas was hydrogen and was set at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min and the oven program was a 3.5 minute hold at 60° C. a ramp to 155° C. at 3.5° C./min. and a ramp to 300° C. at 30° C./min.
Terpene standards were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and the Certificates of Analyses were used to correct mass values. Calibration curves were prepared gravimetrically in diluent solution at concentrations of 1.000, 0.815, 0.655, 0.495, 0.335, 0.175, and 0.015 mg/mL and an internal standard concentration (nonane) of 0.1 mg/mL. The instrument was calibrated according to the manufacturers procedures. The calibration curves were obtained in triplicate on separate days. In addition to requiring correlation coefficients greater than 0.99, the residuals w ere evaluated to verify the quality of the fit. As is typical with standard curve fitting procedures the residuals should show a random distribution with a mean close to zero (2, 32). For laboratories that do not have statistical software, the residuals can be evaluated by calculating the difference of the experimental points from the fitted line and plotting these differences as a function of concentration.
The GC method provided sufficient resolution of all of the terpenes of interest (
Each calibration curve (1.000, 0.815, 0.655, 0.495, 0.335, 0.175, and 0.015 mg/mL) was obtained in triplicate and the charts show the precision and accuracy (residuals) for each calibration level (
The curves for each of the terpenes show good precision and accuracy over the entire range. The RSDs were generally less than 2%. The accuracies of the standards were generally within 2% of predicted values at the high end of the curve and within 8% of predicted values at the low end of the curve. The residuals also exhibit a random distribution with no clear undesirable trends present. Clearly, n-nonane is a more suitable internal standard for the monoterpenes than for the sesquiterpenes, but it performs adequately for both. The table shows the R
Optimization of the oven program and carrier gas flow rate was carried out with solutions of terpene standards. Extensive method development found that a 1.5 μL injection volume and a 20:1 split flow provided the most linear and reproducible calibration curves for all of the analytes. Larger injection volumes resulted in poorer peak shape and loss of resolution. Larger injection volumes also resulted in higher RSDs, presumably from injector back flash due to the use of ethanol as the extraction solvent. Lower split flows resulted in poorer peak shape and loss of resolution while larger split flows resulted in injector discrimination, which reduced the efficacy of the internal standard. It should be noted that we utilized several GCs and they each required slight modification of the split flow and temperatures to achieve similar results.


The assay was run on an Agilent 1290 HPLC system equipped with a G4212A diode array detector, a G 1316C temperature controlled column compartment, a G4226A autosampler, and a G4204A quaternary pump. Separation of the cannabinoids was achieved on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.7 m, 150 mm×2.1 mm i.d., PN 693775-902) with a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 guard column (2.7 μm, 5 mm×2.1 mm i.d., PN 821725-911) in place (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.). Instrument control, data acquisition and integration was achieved with OpenLab CDS ChemStation Rev C.01.06[61] software (Agilent Technologies). The HPLC method uses a 1.5 μL injection volume for all calibration standards, check standards, and sample analyses. Full spectra were recorded from 200-400 nm, and 214 nm was used for quantification of all analytes.
Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid (Sigma Aldrich PN 56302-50ML-GL) in HPLC grade water (Sigma Aldrich Chromasolv® PN 270733-4L) on the A side and 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich Chromasolv® PN 34851-4L) on the B side. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the assay begins with an 8 minute isocratic hold at 66% B, followed by a linear gradient to 95% B over four minutes, 95% B is maintained for one minute, then returns to re-equilibrate the column at 66% B for four minutes before the next injection. The total run time for the method is 17 minutes.
Cannabinoid standards for THCA, CBDA, THC. CBD, CBG, CBC, delta-8 THC, and CBN were obtained from Restek as 1.0 mg/mL solutions in methanol. Calibration solutions for the acidic and neutral forms were prepared separately. Due to legal issues dictating how these standards are supplied it is the most practical manner to combine multiple cannabinoid standards into a single solution with an internal standard. To prepare the calibration solutions 1000 μL of each was placed in a small amber vial and the solvent was evaporated under a gentle flow of argon, after which the vial placed under gentle vacuum until the theoretical weight (1 mg±0.1 mg) was obtained. The residues were dissolved in a total of 4000 uL of diluent to give a stock cannabinoid solution of 0.250 mg/mL with 0.2 mg/mL ibuprofen as the internal standard. The stock solutions of the neutral and acidic moieties were then diluted to concentrations of 0.250, 0.125, 0.063, 0.031, and 0.016 mg/mL.
Each set of calibration curves was obtained in triplicate on separate days, and the calibrations for the acids and neutrals were merged into a single instrumental method within the ChemStation software. The single raw data set was processed to obtain both internal standard calibration curves (ISTD) that referenced IBU as the internal standard and external standard calibration curves (ESTD). In addition to requiring correlation coefficients greater than 0.99, the residuals were evaluated to verify the quality of the fit. As is typical with standard curve fitting procedures the residuals should show a random distribution with a mean close to zero (2, 32).
For laboratories that do not have statistical software, the residuals can be evaluated by calculating the difference of the experimental points from the fitted line and plotting these differences as a function of concentration. This is a critical process for the cannabinoid calibration curves since the “true” values of the validation samples are determined empirically from the curves and this helps ensure they are not biased by non-linearity of the calibration curves.
Since standards for CBGA, THCVA, and CBDVA were not commercially available, both heated and unheated extracts from cultivars known to contain these analytes were analyzed by GCMS and GC-FID to identify the peaks corresponding to the neutral analytes and the approximate ratios. Both unheated and heated extracts were then analyzed by HPLC to identify the retention times of CBGA, THCVA, CBDVA, THCV, and CBDV. Based on similarities of spectral properties and molar absorption coefficients, these analytes were then quantified by referencing known calibration curves. CBGA and CBDVA referenced CBDA, THCVA referenced THCA. CBDV referenced CBD, and THCV referenced THC. Standards for THCV. CBDV, and CBGA eventually became available from Cerilliant and they were used to verify the retention times and calibrate the instruments.
The HPLC method provided sufficient resolution of the major cannabinoids of interest in 17 minutes (
The charts in 
Extensive method development and day-to-day application found that the lower calibration levels (0.016-0.250 mg/mL) and smaller injection volumes (1.5 uL) maintained resolution in real samples, eliminated retention time drift, and prolonged column life. Typically, close to 1000 injections can be performed before the guard column needs to be replaced.


All instrumental assays for terpenes and cannabinoids at a single dilution ratio were configured to use the associated software packages (ChemStation C.01.06[61] on the Agilent 1290 and TotalChrom 6.3.2 on the Clarus 680) to calculate wt % values based on ISTD calibration curves, which was nonane (0.1 mg/mL) for the terpenes and IBU (0.2 mg/mL) for the cannabinoids. For analysis of both major and minor cannabinoids, which required two dilution factors, the intermediate values were obtained from ESTD calibration curves and reported as Raw wt %. In order to correct for recovery in the sample preparation and dilution process the final weight percent for each dilution factor, y, was calculated according to the following equation (vide infra):


and; (A
PRSDs were calculated according to the equation:

where C is the analyte concentration expressed as a mass fraction.
These correction factors were also programmed into ChemStation for automated reporting of both the raw results and the corrected values.
Thus, the present disclosure teaches methods of measuring cannabinoids and terpenes using three standards. The Ibu (0.2 mg/mL in initial extraction solution and dilution solution) and n-nonane (0.2 mg/mL in initial extraction solution and dilution solution) internal standards are present at known concentrations throughout the analysis process. These internal standards are thus independent of changes in dilution, because the concentrations remain unchanged. The third external standard, BPCA (e.g. 2.0 mg/mL only in extraction solution) is present at a known initial concentration, but is allowed to vary during processing or subsequent dilutions. In this way, the ratio of the first two standards to the third standard can be used to determine how much of the original extraction is actually measured.
The null hypothesis for evaluating sample extraction was taken as 1000 mg of pre-ground sample, 15 mL of extraction solvent, and dilutions of Ix (neat), 6× and 96×. These parameters were chosen based on literature reviews (3, 4, 5, 6, 7), expected analyte concentration levels, and instrument calibration levels. These values allowed quantification of analytes in the ranges of 0.02%-1.5% for terpenes (1×), 0.14%-2.3% for minor cannabinoids (6×), and 2.3%-36% for major cannabinoids (96×). All extractions were performed with the 1600 MiniG reciprocating vertical disrupter (OPS Diagnostics) using 50 ml, polypropylene conical vials.
The extraction procedure was optimized for bead type, bead size, bead volume, and homogenization time (n=3). The robustness of the procedure with respect to solvent volume and sample size was evaluated (n=3). The robustness of the method with respect to sample phenotype/chemotype was evaluated by extracting five different cultivars (n=3), and these results were compared to typical sonication methods.
The LOQ was determined experimentally by injecting standard solutions in triplicate. The LOQ was the concentration that provided results that were within 20% of the nominal value. The LOQ was 0.008 mg/mL for both the cannabinoids and the terpenes.
Precision
The instrumental precision was evaluated by injecting all standards in triplicate. The intra-day precision was evaluated by extracting and analyzing five different cultivars with different cannabinoid and terpene profiles five times on one day, while the inter-day precision was determined by extracting and analyzing the same cultivars on separate days.
Use of Check Standards
Check standards are a critical component to monitoring assay performance. The terpene check standard consists of a mixture of two monoterpenes, a terpenol, and a sesquiterpene with 0.1 mg/mL nonane. The cannabinoid check standard is a mixture of CBD, CBDa, THC, and THCA with 0.2 mg/mL ibuprofen. These are analyzed at the start, middle, and end of every sample set and the values are control charted. Values deviating by five percent indicate re-evaluation of the results and/or assay is required, however variation over the course of a run is typically less than one percent.
Application of the Method
As an example of the utility of this method, plants from a state-of-the-art production facility were sampled at the cultivation site to illustrate the variability that occurs with this agricultural crop. This method was also used to generate results that were compared to those obtained by other California analytical labs using different methodologies.
The use of nonane as the internal standard for terpene analysis is analytically rigorous and compensates for variability in recovery and peak area in typical fashion. The use of both ibuprofen and BPCA in the cannabinoid assay, however, requires some discussion.
The method of using two different internal standards for different purposes was the result of several factors encountered during method development and sample analysis, 1) The availability, stability, cost, and supplied form of cannabinoid analytical standards can make it impractical for many labs to prepare multiple calibration solutions with different concentrations of internal standards. 2) The linear range of the cannabinoid assay was approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude (0.016-0.250 mg/mL), however analyte concentrations can span over 2 orders of magnitude (0.1%-40% by weight), and this requires separate dilution ratios for both the minor and major cannabinoids to remain in the linear range of the calibration curve. 3) When testing unknown samples (especially water hash and extracts), the cannabinoid concentrations are unpredictable and can be even higher (as high as 80% by weight). Since the sample has already been processed, the only way to bring the properly stored extraction slurry (4 C for no longer than 24 hours) into the linear range for reanalysis is to use a larger dilution factor.
When an assay and calibration curves are developed with an internal standard present, the concentration of the internal standard in the final aliquot for analysis must remain fixed at the level used to generate the calibration curves. If it is anticipated a sample is “typical” and only the major cannabinoid profile is desired (2.5%-36% by weight with the given mass and solvent ratios), only a single 96-fold dilution is needed. In this case, spiking the sample with 1 mL of internal standard spike solution, adding 14 mL of diluent, extracting the sample, and then diluting 96-fold provides an aliquot for analysis with a theoretical 0.2 mg/mL IBU for analysis with the HPLC method that utilizes the ISTD curve.
While the use of IBU as the internal standard in the aforementioned manner is analytically rigorous and is employed by our laboratory at times, we typically use the method described herein where BPCA is used as the internal standard. In this case the surrogate is added to the sample at a fixed concentration via the extraction solution and variation in analyte recovery due to sample preparation and/or dilution is estimated by the recovery of the surrogate, which can then be used as a correction factor for the raw result. The instrument parameters are set to use the ESTD calibration curves, and a correction factor given by Equation 1 is applied to the raw result. This procedure is also analytically rigorous, and while it does not benefit generation of the calibration curves as with the first method, careful method development to ensure linearity and injection precision mitigates this issue. This procedure has the added benefits that it does not rely on the precision and/or accuracy of internal standard spikes by different lab technicians, and it can be applied to any dilution ratio needed by comparing the experimental peak area of the surrogate to the known peak area of the surrogate determined at each concentration.
In this specific case, the extraction solution with BPCA at 2.0 mg/mL is diluted 6-fold (0.333 mg/mL) and 96-fold (0.021 mg/mL) in replicate and the average peak areas are determined. The correction for recovery is then given by Equation 1 for each of those dilution factors. If a processed sample is found to be outside the linear range of the calibration curve a correction factor can quickly be determined at a different dilution ratio, and the properly stored extract re-diluted for analysis. This process is much faster than preparing new calibration solutions of expensive cannabinoid standards with internal standards at the appropriate concentrations and recalibrating the instrument. Typically, the reporting methods and appropriate correction factors for several dilution factors are stored in the ChemStation software and simply applied to the individual sample dilutions as needed.
To demonstrate the use of this correction again, a CO
Table 3 shows the results for both corrected and uncorrected values. In all cases the corrected values are much closer to the true value, RSDs are reduced by half, and the relative error is also greatly reduced. While gross errors such as an error of 20% in sample volumes still show some deviation from the true value, they are still reasonable and typical dilution errors are easily compensated for as shown by the first set of dilutions. This also demonstrates the ability of a single BPCA concentration to compensate for recovery at both a 6-fold (169 mg in 100 mL) and 96-fold (267 mg in 10 mL) dilution.


To demonstrate the applicability to typical sample processing, a sample of flowers was homogenized in a stainless steel coffee grinder and two different technicians each analyzed five separate samples in replicate (n=5) using a different pipette technique for diluting each sample. The techniques were standard with pre-wetting the tip (1), reverse pipette (2), standard with rinsing the pipette tip in the diluent (3), multichannel pipette (4), and serial dilution (5). They were specifically instructed to show “less care”, so this was not an evaluation of the various pipetting techniques. In this case the “true” value is not known since it is being determined by the analyses so the average values are represented as the lines in 
If the samples generally have known analyte concentrations and ranges, the linear range of the assay, volumes of spike solution with IBU, and dilution ratios can be tailored to use a single internal standard (IBU) in the typical fashion with the ISTD calibration curves. Verifying a wider linear range for a single calibration curve would simplify the situation, however a linear calibration range (as determined via analysis of both correlation coefficients and residuals) on an HPLC-UV assay over 2 orders of magnitude (for concentrations of THCA from 0.1% to almost 40%) can be difficult to attain. Likewise, once cannabinoid standards are made available in pure solid forms it will become easier to prepare multiple calibration solutions with different internal standards and concentrations. However, for a lab processing a large amount of unknowns, having a second method that used a surrogate (BPCA) to correct for recovery at any dilution factor provided a pragmatic solution that minimized variability and systematized the process while still accommodating the wide range of analyte concentrations. There are some well-known limitations to using a single surrogate at a single concentration to approximate the behavior of a number of analytes with a wide range of concentrations, however method development and validation suggest this process performs adequately for this assay.
High Throughput Homogenizers (HTH) have been used for homogenizing microorganisms, plant tissues, and animal tissues using a variety of grinding media and formats that range from 96-well plates to 125 mL plastic serum bottles (13). The key to effective homogenization is to find the optimal combination of sample mass, solvent volume, bead type, bead volume, and vessel volume for the sample being extracted in order for the grinding media to freely impact the sample. More sophisticated homogenizers allow for a wider range of variables to be manipulated to ensure optimal extraction. Based on expected analyte concentrations and the desire to use relatively larger sample masses to improve reproducibility, initial parameters for sample mass and extraction volume were 1000 mg and 15 mL, respectively. These sizes required 50 mL polypropylene conical vials, and bead material, bead size, bead volume, and extraction time were evaluated.
The absolute quantities extracted and the RSDs were evaluated for each analyte and for the overall totals. Only the totals will be discussed in the interest of brevity since, with very rare exception, they closely mirrored the results for the individual analytes.
First, bead type and size were assessed using 1 mL or 2 mL volumes of beads and four different bead sizes and materials. 
Second, the effect of homogenization time on the total amount extracted and the RSDs was evaluated. 
The robustness of the HTH extraction process was evaluated with respect to solvent volume, sample mass, and sample moisture. The robustness was also evaluated with respect to cultivar and was compared to sonication procedures (sonication for 30 minutes). As with optimization of the HTH parameters, each analyte was examined but only the totals are shown as they closely mirrored the individual analytes.
The robustness of the procedure with respect to cultivar was also evaluated. This is an important step since there is a very wide range of morphologically different flowers that very often contain distinct analyte profiles. While it is not possible to do this for every different cultivar, five cultivars (Pincher's Creek, Canna-Tsu, a proprietary hybrid. Classic Trainwreck and Master Kush) were chosen to cover varying flower morphologies, from loose to compact, and a variety of cannabinoids and terpenes. These same five cultivars were also extracted by traditional sonication procedures and the results were compared to the HTH procedure.
The results for bead beating (BB) and sonicating (S) the five cultivars are shown in 
It's important to acknowledge that recommended sonication parameters in the literature for the extraction of cannabinoids typically use much larger solvent to sample mass ratios, which undoubtedly improves extraction efficiency. However, these larger ratios not only increase the amount of solvent needed for analysis but also reduce the concentrations of many terpenes in the resulting extract to levels that result in unacceptable detection limits, so parameters that were optimized for bead beating were employed. The higher RSDs noted with sonication may also have been due to different locations of sample tubes within the sonication bath, as well as differing flower morphologies. The HTH mitigates all of these issues and this is a critical feature of a high throughput method.
Precision and relative bias for the terpenes was evaluated by spiking standards at low, medium, and high concentrations (n=5) into cannabis that had been stripped of all terpenes by pentane extraction. Rather than spike in each terpene individually, a solution of all of the terpenes in working solution was made at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. This solution was then used to spike the terpenes into 1000 mg of blank cannabis, giving terpene concentrations of approximately 0.025%, 0.175%, and 1.500% in the blank matrix. A volume of extraction solvent was then added such that the total volume (extraction volume plus spike volume) equaled 15 mL. Table 4 shows the exact weight percent of each terpene added to the matrix by the spikes.
In order to evaluate the precision and relative bias of the terpene assay, a solution was used to spike nominal values of 0.24 mg, 1.88 mg, or 15 mg of the terpenes into 1000 mg of blank cannabis, giving terpene concentrations of approximately 0.024%, 0.188%, and 1.500% in the blank matrix (see Table 4). The charts in 
Note that all three terpinenes (Alpha-phellandrene, alpha-terpinene, and terpinolene) exhibit low recoveries. This is a real effect and has been found to occur in extracts kept in clear vials, as was the case for these spike recovery studies. This does not occur with standards kept in clear vials, and the rate of decomposition in extracts is reduced dramatically when amber vials are used (data not shown). If extracts are not to be analyzed immediately, they should be placed in amber vials while awaiting analysis in order to ensure accurate results for these analytes.


Since analytical standards are not available in quantities required for evaluating spike recovery at realistic concentrations, three separate pentane extracts (A, B, and C) were generated, the acidic cannabinoids were quantified, and they were spiked back into 1000 mg of the extracted blank matrix at low, medium, and high concentrations (n=5). The extracts were then heated at 240° C. for 15 minutes to provide three more extracts (D, E, and F) with the neutral cannabinoids. Since there was not a clearly dominant CBGA cultivar available for extraction, evaluation of CBG(A) was carried out with the same extract used for evaluating THC(A). Table 5 shows the weight percent of each cannabinoid added to the matrix by the spikes.
It should also be noted that two separate blank matrices (X and Y) were used. Repeated passive pentane extraction always left residual amounts of the cannabinoids in the blanks when analyzed after bead beating. In order to minimize the effects of this residual background, the blank with the lowest amount of residual analyte corresponding to the analyte being spiked was used. The combinations are also shown in Table 5. The residual background amount of each analyte was subtracted from each of the spike recovery results. Table 6 shows the residual analyte remaining in each of the blank matrices.
To evaluate the precision and relative bias for cannabinoids, concentrated extracts were made containing THC(A), CBD(A), THCV(A), and CBG(A) and were spiked back into the blank matrix. Levels found in each extract determined the high, medium, and low levels for each analyte. THC(A) and CBD(A) were more concentrated and could be spiked in at higher levels than THCV(A) and CBG(A) (see Table 5).




The charts in 
Instrumental precision was determined by injecting each calibration level in triplicate over different days. This was shown in 
A robust assay should be applicable to a wide range of cultivars and analytes, and give similar precision and recovery when performed multiple times on one day and over different days. Both intra-day and inter-day precisions for the entire extraction and analysis process were determined by extracting five cultivars (Pincher's Creek, Classic Trainwreck, ACDC, Proprietary Hybrid, and Master Kush) five times over the course of five days, and five times on a single day. These cultivars were chosen to obtain a broad representation of analyte profiles and flower morphologies. In order to start with a homogeneous sample, a 20 g sample of flowers was homogenized on the first day for extraction and the remainder of the ground flower was stored at −20° C. in between extractions. The inter-day analyses were carried out on days 1-5, while the intra-day analyses were all carried out on day five (n=5).
Approximately half of the terpenes failed to meet acceptable inter-day precision limits while they passed intra-day precision criteria. This was a consequence of our sampling methodology, where large amounts of flowers were pre-ground and stored at −20° C. to ensure a more homogenous sample for testing over the course of the study. After grinding there is a rapid decrease of the more volatile monoterpenes once flowers are homogenized in a grinder and the trichomes are ruptured. This loss occurs even when stored at −20° C. This decrease is most significant on day one after the initial homogenization, and this can be seen in 
In general, this terpene assay provides intra-day precisions of less than 2% for all major analytes. Presumably the inter-day precisions would also satisfy requirements if fresh flowers were used for every analysis, and this can even be seen for most analytes if Day 1 is eliminated from the analysis.
In order to better understand the variability associated with medical cannabis production, a state-of-the-art production facility was subjected to extensive sampling and chemotype analyses. All plants were genetically identical, at the same stage of development, planted in the same potting mix, situated together on one table, and all watering, fertilizing, and other routine maintenance had been performed in the same manner for all of the test subjects. One third of the total population was randomly chosen across the growing area for sampling. Samples of flowers were taken from each plant at three vertical locations within the plant canopy. The samples were allowed to dry to approximately 10% moisture at ambient temperature, and then trimmed to mimic medical cannabis flowers. Flowers were stored at −20° C. in sealed plastic containers until analyses.
The total cannabinoids in the flowers ranged from 12.4-25.0% (w/w) of the dried plant material. 
The range of total terpenes in the plants was 1.42-2.19% (w/w). 
Variability is inherent in agricultural crops and not due to any special causes, however in this case a detailed analysis suggested plant G was indeed an outlier. The relative content of the individual terpenes is shown as a bar chart in 
These results demonstrate the potential for differences in secondary metabolite levels in plants with identical genetic background, grown in the same environment, and handled with the same care and maintenance. Understanding plant variability is critical when obtaining a “representative” sample of flowers that will be used to determine the content of pharmacologically active compounds. In this case, if only one or two flowers had been sampled from the table and plant G had been included an erroneous chemotype and potency for that lot would have been reported, even from a lab using validated methodology. The potency of plant G with respect to THCA was about half that of the other plants, so labs testing different flowers from this lot would have obtained different results and this could conceivably have led to difficulties with patients attempting to self-titrate their dosage. In addition, if patients wanted the effects of myrcene (sedative, antinociceptive (18, 19)) and unexpectedly got alpha-pinene (stimulant, bronchodilator, anti-inflammatory (20)) this may have caused some discomfort and concern.
While “outliers” may be rare, even testing only one or two flowers from normal population distributions can give quite different results for absolute content. A completely random sample and a large sample mass are both critical to obtaining representative analytical results for any given lot of medical cannabis. Skilled cultivators and plant scientists are also essential for preventing and/or recognizing outliers, such as plant G, in the plant population prior to reaching the patient.
While cultivation may contribute to the variability of test results, the analytical lab itself can be another contributing factor. A number of samples were obtained from dispensaries and analyzed both in house and sent out for testing by other laboratories in California. The results ranged from minor differences in absolute analyte levels to complete misidentification of analytes. Given the variability inherent in this crop, as discussed above, this section focuses on the latter cases, which are more difficult to attribute to plant variability.
Unlike flowers, extracts are homogeneous and it is not unreasonable to expect similar results from different laboratories. Table 7 shows the analytical results obtained for an extract tested in-house using the methods of the present invention compared to the results from the same samples from different laboratory for analysis. While the outsourced testing provided slightly lower values for both THCA and THC the most interesting result is the lack of any CBGA and the presence of CBDA, which contrasts with our findings and the common observation that typical Chemotype I cultivars contain CBGA (the precursor to THCA) and no CBDA. Presumably, due to the very close retention times of CBGA and CBDA in many assays. CBGA has been misidentified as CBDA by this testing facility. The results of the terpene analyses by the two labs are also shown in Table 7. A number of the results such as limonene, linalool, and humulene are quite close, however there are substantial errors with both myrcene and caryophyllene and these are two of the more commonly occurring terpenes in cannabis.


Table 8 shows the terpene profiles of three flowers from different cultivars that were divided and tested in-house and sent to a different California testing facility.


The first example is a cultivar designated Purple Trainwreck. Terpinolene is the defining terpene of the Trainwreck class of cultivars, yet it was conspicuously absent in the out-sourced test results. Similarly, Kryptonic is typically defined by a limonene and caryophyllene dominant terpene profile with very small amounts of pinene and myrcene, yet the test results from the other facility indicated a pinene and caryophyllene dominant profile. OG Legend is another limonene dominant cultivar followed by caryophyllene, linalool, and myrcene at similar concentrations. However, the outsourced testing indicated linalool and pinene dominance. These examples were chosen because although changes in absolute concentrations may be seen due to handling, these types of large-scale changes in the relative profiles are not observed if the sample is treated properly. Admittedly, the samples may have been mixed up during the “intake” process and this may be an issue with the laboratories inventory management and reporting structure and not the assays, but the end result of inaccurate reporting is still problematic.
The final example is arguably the most egregious of the offenses. The photo in 
Cannabis samples designated for cannabinoid and terpene analysis were chemically desiccated. Samples were placed in either a lidded plastic storage container 665.5 cm
Various amounts of DampRid® were tested in teach sample as shown in Table 9 below to test ratios of desiccant that could dry the flowers within 72 hours. After 96 hours, samples were placed in an oven and were heated.


The results of this experiment showed that 72 hours was sufficient to reach a steady state moisture level for the samples tested. While the period between 24 and 72 hour resulted in an average of 40-50% mass loss due to moisture removal, the period between 72, and 96 hours only saw an average of 2-4% additional mass loss.
Moreover the results showed that ratios of 10:1 of DampRid® CaCL
The inventors of the present invention suspected that sample drying using ovens, or other heat or forced air processing, was skewing the results of downstream cannabinoid and terpene analysis. Without wishing to be bound to any single theory, the present inventors believed that oven drying resulted in the loss of mass via loss of cannabinoid and terpenes. The ultimate consequence was believed to be that oven-dried analyses of cannabis samples were not representative of the non-analyzed cannabis tissue sold to the consumer at dispensaries (which had not been subjected to the same heat treatment).
In order to test their hypothesis, the inventors compared the moisture content of various cannabis samples as measured by complete chemical desiccation vs oven drying against a “true” moisture content measured by FTIR.
Cannabis samples for 18 different cannabis varieties were obtained for this analysis. These samples had been previously cured for consumption. The process of curing typically involves hanging the harvested inflorescences in a dry environment for 10-30 days. These specific samples were pulled directly from dispensary shelves, and were thus in their “consumer” state.
5 grams of each sample were ground in a coffee grinder to produce a homogenous cannabis tissue powder according to the methods described herein. The ground tissue was separated into three parts for moisture analysis via oven drying, chemical desiccation, and FTIR, 1 gram of from ground sample was separated and dried via standard oven drying procedures. According to procedures recommended in the AHP monograph, 1000 mg of sample is placed in an oven at 105 C for 2 hours. A second gram from the ground sample was separated and dried via the chemical desiccation methods of the present invention as described in Example 16. For this chemical desiccation, samples were placed in a sealed container with a 20:1 mass ratio of DampRid® (calcium chloride) to sample.
The chemical desiccation was considered complete when the mass of each sample reached a steady-state. Typically this is after 96 hours, but in this case the samples were allowed to stand for two weeks. Table 10 below shows the calculated moisture contents of each sample as determined via oven drying and chemical desiccation.


A third portion from the ground sample was analyzed for moisture content by FTIR. The above-calculated moisture contents of each sample from Table 10 were compared against the moisture content values from the FTIR. The values were plotted in a graph and a correlation coefficient for was calculated for the IR moisture values vs the oven and chemical desiccation values. The R2 correlation coefficient for the moisture content of FTIR vs. oven drying was 0.52. The R2 correlation coefficient for the moisture content of FTIR vs. chemical desiccation was 92.2.
These results suggested that chemical desiccation moisture content calculations were more accurate than those obtained via oven-drying procedures. This is also evidence that the additional loss of mass calculated for oven drying samples, included non-moisture losses, including potentially cannabinoids and terpenes.
These results also suggest the possibility that current protocols for sample drying could be replaced by FTIR measurement of moisture content.
To test the effect of chemical desiccation and oven drying on analyte content, 1 g of whole finished flowers was placed over 20 g CaCl


These results suggest that the greater mass loss obtained from oven drying methods is largely due to loss of non-water volatile compounds. For example, 
The results of this example provide additional evidence that traditional oven-drying methods of sample drying overestimate moisture content and greatly affect terpene and cannabinoid contents of cannabis samples.
In this example, finished cannabis flower tissue was ground up in a stainless steel coffee grinder in order to increase the surface area of the flowers and speed desiccation.
Flower tissue from three different cultivars (PEVA, ACDC, and PCGA) were ground and one gram of each sample was placed in a container with 20 g of either CaCL
Table 12 below summarizes the results of the experiment.


This experiment demonstrates that other chemical desiccants may be used for moisture quantification of cannabis samples. The results of Table 12 show that both CaCL

If ˜1000 mg of a sample contains ˜20% THCA, this would correspond to a loss of approximately 26 mg of CO

ACTIVE FRACTION FROM THERAPEUTIC CANNABIS PLANT EXTRACTS,16908381,2020-06-22,Utility,Patented Case,2023-02-15,James Castillo,US20200317631A1,2020-10-08,11597712.0,2023-03-07,,,,,Y,"MELLER, MICHAEL V",1655,"Jenny's Rose, LLC",5764,179776.0,2875-1026,Small,"The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 10,471,113, titled PRODUCING CANNABIS EXTRACTS VIA SELECTIVE DECARBOXYLATION, filed on 26 Mar. 2019, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Not applicable.
The present invention is in the art of extracting natural products from plant materials and is more specifically directed to a process for making cannabis extracts.
The cannabis plant (
As of August 2019, ten U.S. states have legalized the recreational use of cannabis, and thirty-two U.S. states have legalized the use of all cannabis products for medicinal purposes while an additional five states allow use of CBD oil. As the state-level legalization of cannabis has expanded, so has the production of cannabis-derived products. Cannabis extracts (sometimes known as “cannabis oils”) have emerged as an important category of cannabis-derived product. Cannabis extracts are produced by subjecting cannabis to an extraction process, wherein solvents are typically used to dissolve (“extract”) chemical compounds from harvested cannabis plant material.
However, in the typical extraction process, the goal is to obtain purified extracts containing high concentrations of the cannabinoids, and discarding portions of the extract containing waxes, lipids, and other components of plant materials that do not contain the desired cannabinoids. As such portions of the extracts do not contain cannabinoids, they are not believed to possess therapeutic or commercial value.
For example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,195,159 (the '159 patent) describes a process for removing what it describes as the unwanted “ballast” from cannabis plant extracts. The ballast described therein includes plant cell constituents comprising “fats, waxes, carbohydrates, proteins and sugars.” The'159 patent inventors explain that “[t]he presence of these substances results in botanical extracts which may be hygroscopic, difficult to reduce to a powder and generally intractable as starting materials for pharmaceutical preparations.” In addition, the '159 patent explains “that presence of ballast may also limit the shelf-life of pharmaceutical products formulated from such extracts.” The '159 patent also explains that some elements of ballast can be “removed by an additional step post-extraction referred to as “winterization”, which involves making a concentrated solution of the extract and cooling it to a temperature at which a proportion of waxes and lipid components may be precipitated, typically −20° C.”
WO2018187500A1 (the '500 application) describes a process for removing waxes and lipids from crude cannabis extracts before the process of decarboxylation and purification of the extracts to obtain purified cannabis extracts. The '500 application explains that crude cannabis extracts are known to contain high concentration of waxes and other hydrocarbons from plant materials. Such waxes and plant materials are typically removed or reduced by a “winterization process” prior to decarboxylation and purification of the cannabis extract. The “winterization process” is typically performed by dissolving the distillate in alcohol which is then subjected to subzero temperatures to separate out the fats and waxes. In the '500 application, the winterization process involves dissolving the distillate in 200-proof ethanol and then placing in the solution in a freezer at −20° C. for 4 hours. While cold, the precipitated material containing the unwanted fats and waxes is filtered out using a filter funnel and the filter was rinsed with 100 ml of ice cold ethanol. The filtered ethanolic solution of the distillate was evaporated to dryness to give 84.0 g residue (78% CBD content). The '500 application described that the CBD recovery in this step is 99.0%, demonstrating that the typical extraction process focuses on removing waxes and lipids during the extraction process, in favor of producing a concentrated cannabinoid residue or extract.
Surprisingly, it has been found that a fraction that is typically discarded, containing the waxes and lipids, is important to the therapeutic value of the extract. This is because it is becoming recognized that the plant's therapeutic value may not be attributable to the major cannabinoids alone. Rather, the therapeutic value may lie in a synergistic effect between numerous chemical components present in the cannabis plants. The plant is believed to contain over a hundred cannabinoids, numerous secondary metabolites of cannabis, terpenes and terpenoids, all of which are hypothesized to contribute synergistically to the plant's therapeutic benefits. This interaction or synergy resulting from the complex mixture of compounds present within the cannabis plant is variously known as the “entourage effect,” in which a mixture of compounds present demonstrates greater therapeutic efficacy than any of its constituent compounds in isolation.
Capturing the non-cannabinoid portions of the extract that would assist in preserving the “entourage effect,” while removing plant matter that may detract from the stability or safety of the formulation during the extraction process is challenging. When breaking down the plant matter, the initial extract contains particulate materials, chlorophyll, large sugars, such as plant cellulose, and proteins that may not have the desired effects and impact other aspects of the product, such as its shelf-life and stability. Thus, there is a need to develop an extraction process whereby undesirable plant materials are removed, but desirable waxes and lipids, which assist in creating the “entourage effect”, are not inadvertently discarded. This portion of the extract, called the “remainder”, which contains the desirable waxes and lipids, may also be removed prior to the cannabinoids being decarboxylated. High temperatures typically used during decarboxylation processes may destroy the desirable waxes and lipids in the remainder or convert them into “sand-like” particles which are undesirable in an extract.
The decarboxylation of compounds, such as THCA and THCVA, to form psychoactive or physiologically active compounds, such as Δ9-THC and THCV is typically accomplished by heating the extract (or by directly heating the plant material). A major drawback of oven-based decarboxylation is the tendency to cause the loss of desirable volatile compounds, such as caryophyllene and other terpenes, through evaporation or heat-induced chemical reactions. Accordingly, a process is needed to enable a greater degree of control over the decarboxylation of cannabis extracts.
The present invention is a process for producing various types of cannabis extract from harvested cannabis. A quantity of harvested cannabis, which typically includes the inflorescence, floral leaves, and small stems of a flowering cannabis plants, is pre-frozen. The harvested cannabis is first subjected to cryogenic grinding to produce pulverized cannabis. The pulverized cannabis is then subjected to alcohol extraction to produce an initial cannabis extract, which can be subjected to one of several forms of further processing according to the desired chemical profile of the final product. The initial cannabis extract may be further fractionated to remove a particulate “remainder fraction” and the resulting cannabinoid fraction may then be subjected to chemical processing that promote the conversion of THCA to Δ9 THC; the conversion of THCVA to THCV; the conversion of THCA to cannabinol (“CBN”); or the conversion of THCA to Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC). The various fractions can be mixed in various proportions. The presence or absence of the remainder fraction does not significantly affect subsequent fractionation; however if the remainder fraction is captured, it can be used to augment the other fractions.
The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the general principles of the present invention have been defined herein specifically to provide a cannabis extraction method that produces a biologically active remainder fraction.
The present invention is a process that includes several stages, which are described below as Stages 1-2, 3A-3C, and 4. Where the process refers to the use of “alcohol,” a solution containing at least 99% ethanol by volume or at least 99% isopropyl alcohol by volume is preferred although concentrations as low as about 95% alcohol can be used. Specifically, “ethyl alcohol 200 proof” or “99.9% isopropyl alcohol” supplied by Green Wood Cleaning Products, Inc., of Hollister, Calif., may be used.
Stage 1: Cryogenic Grinding
Referring to 
When pre-freezing is complete, the harvested cannabis is separated into batches (step 
The tumbling apparatus is a horizontally oriented cylindrical drum that is capable of rotating about its own axis. The drum should be capable of performing approximately 40 rotations per minute (rpm). The drum may have a diameter of approximately 60 cm (24 in.) and a length of approximately 91 cm (36 in.). A Triminator® Dry cannabis-trimming machine supplied by Dana Mosman of Boulder, Colo., may serve as the tumbling apparatus.
Five bags of harvested cannabis are placed into the tumbling apparatus. Approximately 680 g (approx. 1.5 lb) of dry ice (i.e., solid carbon dioxide) is placed into the tumbling apparatus along with the bags of harvested cannabis. The dry ice may be in the form of uniformly sized cylindrical pieces that are approximately 0.64 cm (0.25 in.) in diameter and approximately 5.0 cm (2.0 in) in height. Dry-ice “nuggets” supplied by Praxair Technology, Inc., of Danbury, Conn., may be used.
The bags of harvested cannabis are tumbled at approximately 40 rpm for about 10 minutes. The appropriate rotational speed can be achieved with a Triminator® Dry cannabis-trimming machine or with a rheostat controlling the motor speed of a dedicated tumbler. During the tumbling process, the agitation of the harvested cannabis within each bag, in conjunction with the physical impacts of the dry ice against the bag, pulverize the harvested cannabis to a fine powder, thereby producing pulverized cannabis 
It will be appreciated that the amount of cannabis that can be processed by the tumbling apparatus depends on the size of the tumbling apparatus. The equipment can readily be scaled up for larger amounts of cannabis.
Stage 2: Alcohol Extraction
Referring to 
Two filter-bags of pulverized cannabis are placed into an extraction apparatus for alcohol extraction (step 
Once immersed, the drum of the extraction apparatus is rotated at approximately 40 rpm for 10 minutes, during which compounds from the pulverized cannabis dissolve into the alcohol. The alcohol normally takes on a bright-green color as extraction proceeds. The alcohol is then poured from the extraction apparatus for collection (step 
The alcohol extract is then passed through a stainless-steel mesh filter or other filter type with a pore diameter of about 32 μm-45 μm (step 
As detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 10,471,113 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), the material, which is known as the “remainder” fraction, removed by the 5 μm filter can be recovered from the surface of the filter (step 
Regardless of which separation technology is employed and how many filtration steps are used, the final filtrate (step 
A CUP-30 Centrifuge Utility Platform Alcohol Extraction System (the “CUP-30 system”) made by Delta Separations LLC of Santa Rosa, Calif., may serve as the extraction apparatus. The ratio of alcohol to pulverized cannabis described above (i.e., approximately 40 L of alcohol for every 2 filter-bags of pulverized cannabis) may be scaled up to fully use the processing capacity of the CUP-30 system.
Stage 3A: Conversion of Tetrahydrocannabinolic Acid in the Initial Cannabis Extract to Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol
Referring to 
The second diluted solution is refluxed at 80-100° C. for 1-3 hours, preferably 80° C. for 2 hours, to promote the decarboxylation of THCA to form Δ9-THC (step 
Refluxing may be used to process the initial cannabis extract in batches of 300 ml. Batch sizes may be adjusted according to the capacity of the refluxing apparatus.
Stage 3B: Conversion of Tetrahydrocannabivaric Acid in the Initial Cannabis Extract to Tetrahydrocannabivarin
Referring to 
Stage 3C: Increasing Cannabinol Content of Initial Cannabis Extract
Referring to 
Referring to 
Stage 4: Increasing Δ8-Tetrahydrocannabinol Content of the Initial Cannabis Extract
Referring to 
The resulting mixture is subjected to distillation using a short-path distillation apparatus (the “distillation apparatus”). The distillation apparatus is composed of a feed flask, which contains the mixture. The feed flask is placed on a combination hotplate-magnetic stirrer, which allows a liquid within the feed flask to be simultaneously heated and agitated by a stir bar. The feed flask is attached to a condenser, which, in turn, is preferably attached to a “triple cow”-style distillation receiver with a connection point for a vacuum source. Two flasks are connected to the distillation receiver, the first for collecting undesirable distillates (the “waste flask”); and the second for collecting desirable distillates (the “collection flask”). Unneeded connections on the distillation apparatus should be sealed with stoppers. The temperature of the condenser is maintained at 21-23° C. (70-74° F.) by the circulation of water. A distillation receiver (Mfr. No. CG-1276-01) supplied by Thomas Scientific LLC of Swedesboro, N.J., may be used.
The mixture is placed into the feed flask, and the waste flask is placed in a position to receive distillate. The distillation apparatus is connected to a vacuum source, and the pressure within the distillation apparatus is reduced to approximately 66.7 Pa (500 mTorr or 6.7×10
Once the mixture reaches about 140° C., the distillate should take on a bluish color as azulene and derivatives thereof begin to distil from the mixture. Heating of the mixture should continue at the rate of approximately 1° C. per minute until the mixture reaches 157° C. During the heating period, bluish distillate continues to distill from the mixture and is collected in the waste flask (step 
The colorless distillate is collected in the collection flask, which should be rotated into position as soon as bluish distillate stops appearing. The temperature of the mixture is further increased at the rate of approximately 1° C. per minute until it reaches 175° C. The distillate, which now contains Δ8-THC, continues to be collected in the collection flask during this period (step 
The refined cannabis extract enriched in Δ8-THC

The present invention relates generally to a smoking cigarette for smoking a smoking medium such as a narcotic, herbs or a medicated substance. In one aspect, the invention relates more particularly to an additive for such a smoking cigarette comprising 
Conventionally, 
Further, in the process of forming a smoking cigarette, it is conventional practice to insert a torn piece of cigarette paper at a mouth end of the rolled smoking cigarette so as to act as a filter and thereby prevent the smoking medium from being sucked through the mouth end of the cigarette and into the user's mouth. Typically, this torn piece of cigarette paper is removed from the tubular container containing the smoking medium and formed by rolling a sheet of the cigarette paper.
According to an aspect of the invention there is provided an additive for a cigarette which is for smoking a smoking medium, comprising:
a non-flammable carrier;
a body of semisolid 
the non-flammable carrier having a gripping portion thereof which is connected to the support portion and uncovered by the semisolid 
Thus is provided a simple arrangement for handling 
Preferably, the carrier is a metallic thread.
Preferably, the carrier is made from stainless steel.
Preferably, the carrier is deformable so that, as the semisolid 
In one arrangement, the additive further includes wrapping paper removably covering the body of semisolid 
Preferably, the semisolid 
In one arrangement, the carrier further includes a filter portion coupled to the support portion of the carrier and located externally of the body of semisolid 
In one such arrangement, the support portion is located transversely centrally of the filter portion such that the filter portion is radially enlarged relative thereto.
In an arrangement where the carrier is formed from a thread, the gripping and support portions defined by the thread lie along a common longitudinal axis and the filter portion is formed by a coil of the thread encircling said axis.
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a holder for a cigarette which is for smoking a smoking medium, the cigarette including a tubular container receiving the smoking medium, the holder comprising:
a non-flammable gripping portion extending longitudinally from a first end of the gripping portion to a second end thereof for handling;
a filter portion coupled to the second end of the gripping portion and extending longitudinally from a smoking medium side to a mouth side which is distal to the first end of the gripping portion relative to the smoking medium side of the filter portion;
the filter portion defining a passageway fluidically communicating the smoking medium side and the mouth side so that smoke from combustion of the smoking medium can pass from the smoking medium side of the filter portion through the passageway and to the mouth side of the filter portion to be subsequently inhaled by a user;
the filter portion being enlarged in a transverse direction relative to the gripping portion; and
the gripping and filter portions being arranged to be located within the tubular container of the cigarette.
Thus is provided an arrangement which serves as both a holder and filter available when forming a smoking cigarette manually.
In one arrangement, the gripping portion is located transversely centrally of the filter portion such that the filter portion is radially enlarged relative thereto.
Preferably, the gripping portion is deformable relative to the longitudinal direction so that, as the smoking medium is consumed, a portion of the gripping portion previously contained within the tubular container of the cigarette can be deformed from an original condition so as not to protrude longitudinally from the tubular container.
In one arrangement, the filter portion is formed by a coil of thread encircling a longitudinally oriented axis.
According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a cigarette comprising:
providing:

depositing the smoking medium on one side of the paper;
locating the holder on said one side of the paper; and
once the smoking medium and the holder are disposed on said one side of the paper, rolling the paper transversely to the holder so as to form the tubular container receiving the smoking medium and the holder therein, the holder being oriented generally parallel to an axis of the tubular container.
In one arrangement, the holder includes a longitudinally elongated gripping portion and a filter portion coupled thereto and extending longitudinally from a smoking medium side to a mouth side distal to the gripping portion relative to the smoking medium side of the filter portion, the filter portion being enlarged in a transverse direction relative to the gripping portion. In such an arrangement, rolling the paper to form the tubular container comprises shaping the tubular container to a diameter of the filter portion.
