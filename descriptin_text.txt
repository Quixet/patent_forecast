What has been discovered are unique and novel, essentially anhydrous, dietary supplement compositions comprising: a) a 
Dietary supplement compositions and more specifically, Dietary supplement compositions that contain

The use of 
The present invention is to provide an improved means to relieve various ailments such as joint pain and anxiety associated with domestic animals and humans by increasing degree of bioavailability through sublingually and/or buccal absorption of the composition, and more specifically, increasing degree of bioavailability through sublingually and/or buccal absorption of Cannabidiol henceforth referred to CBD; a component of 
What has been discovered is that when CBD, is combined with an edible oil or a combination of edible oils having a saturated fat content of about less than about 15 percent by weight and having a polyunsaturated fat content greater than 44 percent by weight, allow for a more rapid sublingual and/or buccal absorption of CBD; a unique and novel composition results that allows for greater efficacy and efficiently of the CBD compound.
The attributes of CBD use for the relief of pain and anxiety is well documented in the literature. In a recent study conducted by the Kogan, et al, indicated that over eighty percent of veterinarians who participated in a use study, evaluating the use of CBD products, perceived that CBD was very helpful or somewhat helpful for conditions of acute pain, chronic pain and anxiety in dogs.
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved means to relieve various medical ailments such as depression, and nervous disorders such as tourette syndrome associated with humans by increasing the degree of bioavailability through sublingually and/or buccal absorption of the composition, and more specifically, increasing the degree of bioavailability through sublingually and/or buccal absorption of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol also known as Δ-9-THC and it's isomers that are components of Cannabis sativa. The medicinal properties of these compounds are well documented as described in a book written by Michael Backes, and Andrew Weil, MD, entitled: “Cannabis Pharmacy: The Practical Guide to Medical Marijuana.” Currently there are no known medicinal products marketed that are used for sublingually and/or buccal absorption of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The present invention described herein is advantageous over other forms of dosages containing Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. What has been discovered is that when Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is combined with an edible oil or a combination of edible oils having a saturated fat content of about less than about 15 percent and a polyunsaturated fat content greater than 44 percent by weight, allow for a more rapid sublingual and/or buccal absorption of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol a unique and novel composition results that allows for greater efficacy and efficiently of the compound.
Another objective of the present invention is the incorporation of high levels of alpha linolenic acid and gamma linolenic acid that are inherent to the polyunsaturated edible oils used in the present invention. Compositions of the present may contain up to fifty-five percent by weight of alpha linolenic acid. The nutritional attributes of alpha linolenic acid are well documented in the literature and are recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, hereinafter referred to as the FDA, as a nutritional ingredient. Compositions that meet the FDA requirements may be listed as dietary supplement products containing alpha linolenic acid as a “nutritional” ingredient. When alpha linolenic acid is use in the present invention, FDA approved claims such as: “Excellent source of ALA.” or “High in ALA” or “Rich in ALA” can be made.
Additional benefits of alpha linolenic acid, is further documented in a publication by The National Institute of Health dated Nov. 21, 2018, entitled: Omga-3 Fatty Acids, Fact Sheet for Health Professionals.
It has been discovered that in the present invention the combination of the attributes of alpha linolenic acid and the
