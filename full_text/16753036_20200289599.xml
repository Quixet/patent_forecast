<p id="p-0026" num="0033">The flower is the part of the female cannabis plant that typically has the highest concentration of THC, making it the ideal part of the plant for recreational consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">Flowers grow toward the top of the plant and they are commonly referred to as buds.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">The cola is the mass of clustered flowers at the top of the cannabis plant.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0036">Trichomes are the tiny resin glands on the flower's leaves and calyces. With the naked eye, they simply look like crystals; under a macroscopic lens, they can look like crystallized mushrooms. Trichomes evolved to protect the cannabis plant from insects and they typically have higher concentrations of THC. Because hashish is made from the resin heads of trichomes, certain strains of cannabis are specifically bred for their high trichome production.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0037">The calyx is a floral structure that forms when the flower begins the budding process; it looks like a tubular sheath surrounding the ovule and pistils. It is composed of sepals, individual plant segments that are often green and occasionally fuzzy. The calyx's trichomes form with their heads pointing toward the top of the calyx.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0038">Pistils are the pollen-catching hairs that extend from the calyx. They can be red, orange or brown in color. They are not known for containing high levels of THC.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0039">The sugar leaf is a small leaf that grows within the flower and it is usually covered in trichomes because of its positioning. Sugar leaves are typically trimmed when flowers are harvested, but their trichome-coating makes them an ideal ingredient when making cannabis edibles.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">The cannabis seed is hidden within a flower's calyx. Besides planting a seed to grow a cannabis plant, oil can be extracted from a cannabis seed to be used in human food or animal feed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">The Stems provide the structural support for flowers, while also storing and transporting nutrients for them. Stems aren't known for containing high levels THC, but they can be repurposed for their fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">The stalk is the central stem of a plant. As it lacks high levels of THC, it can also be repurposed for its fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">The node is the joint where a leaf branches off from the stalk.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044">The fan leaf is the large leaf that has the photosynthetic responsibility for the cannabis plant. It uses energy from the sun to create chemical energy to feed the plant. Fan leaves lack significant levels of THC, but they have become the unofficial symbol of cannabis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">Reference is herein made to providing preselected plant parts or whole plant (step <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">Reference is herein made to drying, grinding, selecting, extracting and breaking a first extract (step <b>2</b>, <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, <b>2</b><i>c</i>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>)</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0048">Reference is herein made to steps of extracting said preselected plant parts or whole plant to provide a first extract.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">Reference is herein made to steps of heating said preselected plant parts or whole plant or first extract to a predetermined temperature according to a predetermined time protocol</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">Reference is herein made to steps of collecting vapourized and/or particularized material during or after said heating.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">Reference is herein made to steps of rendering said vapourized material and/or particularized into a storable intermediate. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by step <b>5</b>, (fixation). At this fixation step a storable intermediate is provided, of reduced volume relative to the first extract. It is in fact a concentrate of the first extract aforementioned.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0052">Reference is herein made to steps of combining said storable intermediates of different plant parts, whole plants and/or plant varieties in order to provide a desired composition for use in a predetermined delivery form. The predetermined delivery form is selected according to intended use of the final cannabis product, mode of delivery of the final cannabis product, treatment indication for the final cannabis product, THC:CBD ratio or other cannabinoid components and/or terpenes and terpenoid components of the aforementioned first extracts of the final cannabis product.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">In the present invention reference is made to first extracts, which may be cannabis concentrates, commonly referred to as cannabis extracts. These are significantly more potent than standard cannabis buds. Their applications as medicine have proven to be effective for patients suffering from all sorts of ailments. When made properly, a cannabis concentrate is reminiscent of the cannabis strain it was extracted from; the smell, taste, and effects are simply magnified due to a larger concentration by weight. Widely used extraction methods are described below in a non-limiting manner.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4<i>a</i>-4<i>g </i></figref>Types of Cannabis Extracts</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">a. Kief</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">Kief is the simplest of concentrates. Kief is composed of the trichomes (the crystalline structures coating the outside surface of the flowers) broken away from the dried plant material, usually via specialized filtering screens. Kief is generally considered a lower-quality extract, but some top-flight extractors can produce an extremely clean and flavorful product using the dry sieve method. THC content can range from 20 percent to 60 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">b. Dry Sieve (Dry Sift)</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058">A popular form of non-solvent hash is dry sieve (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;dry sift&#x201d;). Dry sieve is a refined version of kief that has been run through a series of screens so that only the trichome heads remain. The level of quality is often determined by amount of plant matter and capitulate trichome stalks found in the final product. This process at its highest level yields nothing but the largest, most perfect trichome gland heads and none of the gland stems, plant matter, etc. that generally clouds the quicker, lower-quality kief extractions. The most pure dry sieve hash should melt completely when exposed to heat, known as full-melt dry sieve hash.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">c. Hash</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0060">Ice water extraction is one of the most common processes used to create quality non-solvent hash. The main goal and fundamental idea behind the ice water extraction process is to isolate the trichome heads, which house the essential oils of cannabis, from the stalks and plant matter.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0061">The quality of the resulting hash is often determined by the size of the isolated trichome heads and the extent to which it melts when heated (full-melt being the best). The most important part of the ice water extraction process is drying the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0062">The powdery kief that coats cannabis flowers can be collected and pressed together to form hash. Additionally solvents like ice water or ethanol may be used to more effectively strip the cannabis plant of its cannabinoid-loaded trichomes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0063">d. Butane Hash Oil (BHO)</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0064">Butane Hash Oil, commonly referred to as BHO, is a type of cannabis concentrate made using butane as the main solvent. While a number of variables can determine the final consistency of BHO (mostly temperature), different names when referring to each of the different consistencies of BHO have been applied. Shatter for instance, refers to the glass-like consistency that often snaps or &#x201c;shatters&#x201d; when handled. Budder, honeycomb, crumble, and sap are also used to describe the different textures, though they all fall under the category of BHO.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0065">Under this form of extraction, THC content can be as high as 80-90%. This makes BHO a popular choice for many medical marijuana patients suffering from chronic pain, sleep disorders, and other intractable symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0066">e. Supercritical CO2 Oil</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0067">Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a supercritical fluid, meaning it converts into a liquid form when pressurized. At the same time, CO2 is a pure chemical substance that occurs naturally and leaves behind no residues. In fact, supercritical CO2 extraction is already a standard extraction method for the food, dry cleaning and herbal supplement industries. It is a common food additive as well.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0068">The CO2 extraction process allows compounds to be extracted with low toxicity, it utilizes a high pressure vessel containing cannabis. Supercritical CO2 is inserted into the vessel and pumped through a filter where it is separated from the plant matter once the pressure is released. Next, the supercritical CO2 evaporates and is dissolved into the cannabinoids.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0069">f. Rick Simpson Oil (RSO)</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0070">Also known as cannabis oil, hemp oil, Phoenix Tears, and Rick Simpson Oil (RSO), whole-plant cannabis oil can be orally administered or applied directly to the skin. Sublingual delivery is the preferred method of treatment for many cancer patients. Not only is it a convenient way to medicate, but intake through the oral mucosal membranes in the mouth provides for rapid and effective absorption directly into the systemic circulation because of the increased bioavailability of the cannabinoids.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0071">Exemplary RSO Small Scale Production Method</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">Place the completely dry material into a clean bucket.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">Dampen the material with the solvent you are using. Many solvents can be used (although it is recommended that you avoid petroleum solvents). You can use ethanol, butane, 99% isopropyl alcohol, or even water. Two gallons of solvent is required to extract the THC from one pound, and 500 ml is enough for an ounce.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0074">Crush the plant material using a stick of clean, untreated wood or any other similar device. Although the material will be damp, it will still be relatively easy to crush up because it is so dry.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0075">Continue to crush the material with the stick, while adding solvent until the plant material is completely covered and soaked. Remain stirring the mixture for about three minutes. As you do this, the THC is dissolved off the material into the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0076">Pour the solvent oil mixture off the plant material into another bucket. At this point you have stripped the material of about 80% of its THC.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">Second wash: again add solvent to the mixture and work for another three minutes to extract the remaining THC.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0078">Pour this solvent oil mix into the bucket containing the first mix that was previously poured out.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0079">Discard the twice washed plant material.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0080">Pour the solvent oil mixture through a coffee filter into a clean container.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0081">Boil the solvent off: a rice cooker will boil the solvent off nicely, and will hold over a half gallon of solvent mixture. CAUTION: avoid stove-tops, red hot elements, sparks, cigarettes, and open flames as the fumes can be extremely flammable.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0082">Add solvent to rice cooker until it is about % full and turn on HIGH heat. Make sure you are in a well-ventilated area and set up a fan to carry the solvent fumes away.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0083">Continue to add mixture to cooker as solvent evaporates until you have added it all to the cooker.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0084">As the level in the rice cooker decreases for the last time, add a few drops of water (about 10 drops of water for a pound of dry material). This will help to release the solvent residue, and protect the oil from too much heat.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0085">When there is about one inch of solvent-water mixture in the rice cooker, swirl the contents until the solvent has finished boiling off.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0086">When the solvent has been boiled off, turn the cooker to LOW heat. At no point should the oil ever reach over 290&#xb0; F. or 140&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0087">Remove the pot containing the oil from the rice cooker. Gently pour the oil into a stainless steel container</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0088">Place the stainless steel container in a dehydrator, or put it on a gentle heating device such as a coffee warmer. It may take a few hours but the water and volatile terpenes will be evaporated from the oil. When there is no longer any surface activity on the oil, it is ready for use.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089">Suck the oil up in a plastic syringe, or in any other container you see fit. A syringe will make the oil easy to dispense. When the oil cools completely it should have the consistency of thick grease.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">g. Rosin</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091">Rosin has been gaining a lot of traction in the medical cannabis community as of lately and for good reason. Rosin is a solid form of resin that is obtained by adding pressure &#x26; heat to vaporize volatile liquid terpenes, typically with an industrial heat press (or even a hair straightener for small batches).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0092">The rosin technique is quick, simple and affordable, allowing anyone to create quality solventless hash in a matter of seconds. To get started making Rosin, you only need a few basic tools in order to create a quality finished product, but not nearly as many as you need with other extraction techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0093">It is herein disclosed an improved method for producing customized cannabis products having predetermined concentrations of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), additional cannabinoids, terpenes and traces and derivatives thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094">It is herein disclosed a pharmaceutically acceptable product in the form of caramel-like edible product comprising a cannabis derived formulation sufficient to reduce blood pressure in a hypertensive human subject by approximately 20 mmg. (diastolic or systolic) within approximately 10-15 mins of consumption.</p>
