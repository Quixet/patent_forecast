<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The field of art to which this invention generally pertains is medical use of cannabis, and specifically to a cannabis dispenser for use by multiple users.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><i>Cannabis </i>has been used for medical purposes and for relief of symptoms for thousands of years, and in the western world since the 18<sup>th </sup>century. Since then and until the present day, the most common route of administration has been by smoking. Due to the known disadvantages of smoking, other routes of administration are desired. This is particularly true for use in public places, and even more so, for treating patients in hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the main alternatives to smoking as a method of administration is the use of vaporizers, which have the advantage of rapidly providing beneficial effects without the health challenges and problems associated with smoking. Vaporizers have been known for many years, and a variety of devices are currently commercially available. Yet, the majority of users still prefer smoking, suggesting that the available vaporizers do not accomplish the desired objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A disadvantage of vaporizers is the need for sophisticated and expensive versions of the apparatus for well-controlled medical treatment and for high yield of cannabis utilization. Another challenge is related to the complexity of operating such sophisticated equipment, particularly in the case of children, elderly and handicapped or sick patients. Hospitals and nursing homes treating multiple cannabis users face additional difficulties related to the need to store a relatively large amount of cannabis serving s of different compositions, doze size and delivery method. Other difficulties are related to the need for tailoring the serving properties to the particular need of the various patients and other challenges faced by the caregivers.</p>
