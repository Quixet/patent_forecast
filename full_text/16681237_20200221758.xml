<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a smoking cigarette for smoking a smoking medium such as a narcotic, herbs or a medicated substance. In one aspect, the invention relates more particularly to an additive for such a smoking cigarette comprising <i>cannabis </i>extract oil to increase potency of the smoking cigarette. In another aspect, the invention relates more particularly to a holder which is to be located within the smoking cigarette.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><i>Cannabis </i>extract oils present a desirable form of tetrahydrocannabinol-containing <i>cannabis </i>for consumption as these extract oils are more potent per volume as compared to a dry ground plant. <i>Cannabis </i>rosin is one example of <i>cannabis </i>extract oil which is becoming increasingly popular as it is free of residual chemicals because the process of forming <i>cannabis </i>rosin does not use solvents such as butane or carbon dioxide as part of a fluid extraction process to extract cannabinoids from a <i>cannabis </i>plant but rather comprises heat and pressure to extract the cannabinoids.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, <i>cannabis </i>extract oils are consumed by dabbing in which is used a specialized glass dab rig having fluidically communicated ends, one of which is adapted for heating and receiving a small body of the <i>cannabis </i>extract oil which is consequently vaporized and the other end receiving a mouth of the user so that the <i>cannabis </i>extract oil vapors can be inhaled. For placement on the dab rig the small body of <i>cannabis </i>extract oil is typically handled by a distinct implement which is separate from the dab rig and used only to releasably transfer the oil body to the corresponding end of the dab rig such that it is not incorporated in the dab rig during the consumption of the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in the process of forming a smoking cigarette, it is conventional practice to insert a torn piece of cigarette paper at a mouth end of the rolled smoking cigarette so as to act as a filter and thereby prevent the smoking medium from being sucked through the mouth end of the cigarette and into the user's mouth. Typically, this torn piece of cigarette paper is removed from the tubular container containing the smoking medium and formed by rolling a sheet of the cigarette paper.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the invention there is provided an additive for a cigarette which is for smoking a smoking medium, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">a non-flammable carrier;</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil for consumption by smoking, the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil being supported on a support portion of the non-flammable carrier such that the support portion is embedded therein;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">the non-flammable carrier having a gripping portion thereof which is connected to the support portion and uncovered by the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil such that the gripping portion protrudes from the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil for handling.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus is provided a simple arrangement for handling <i>cannabis </i>extract oil and which allows it to be incorporated into a cigarette for smoking by combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the carrier is a metallic thread.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the carrier is made from stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the carrier is deformable so that, as the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil is removed from the carrier by combustion, a portion of the carrier previously covered by the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil can be deformed from an original condition so as not to protrude longitudinally from the cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one arrangement, the additive further includes wrapping paper removably covering the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil. Typically the wrapping paper is not consumed during smoking and thus is removed, but prior to smoking when in use the paper prevents the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil from sticking to foreign surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil comprises <i>cannabis </i>rosin.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one arrangement, the carrier further includes a filter portion coupled to the support portion of the carrier and located externally of the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil, the filter portion having a smoking medium side disposed adjacent the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil and an opposite mouth side distal to the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil, the filter portion being enlarged in a transverse direction relative to the support portion, and the filter portion defining a passageway fluidically communicating the smoking medium side and the mouth side so that smoke from combustion of the smoking medium can pass from the smoking medium side of the filter portion through the passageway and to the mouth side of the filter portion to be subsequently inhaled by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one such arrangement, the support portion is located transversely centrally of the filter portion such that the filter portion is radially enlarged relative thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an arrangement where the carrier is formed from a thread, the gripping and support portions defined by the thread lie along a common longitudinal axis and the filter portion is formed by a coil of the thread encircling said axis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a holder for a cigarette which is for smoking a smoking medium, the cigarette including a tubular container receiving the smoking medium, the holder comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">a non-flammable gripping portion extending longitudinally from a first end of the gripping portion to a second end thereof for handling;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">a filter portion coupled to the second end of the gripping portion and extending longitudinally from a smoking medium side to a mouth side which is distal to the first end of the gripping portion relative to the smoking medium side of the filter portion;</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">the filter portion defining a passageway fluidically communicating the smoking medium side and the mouth side so that smoke from combustion of the smoking medium can pass from the smoking medium side of the filter portion through the passageway and to the mouth side of the filter portion to be subsequently inhaled by a user;</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">the filter portion being enlarged in a transverse direction relative to the gripping portion; and</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">the gripping and filter portions being arranged to be located within the tubular container of the cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus is provided an arrangement which serves as both a holder and filter available when forming a smoking cigarette manually.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one arrangement, the gripping portion is located transversely centrally of the filter portion such that the filter portion is radially enlarged relative thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the gripping portion is deformable relative to the longitudinal direction so that, as the smoking medium is consumed, a portion of the gripping portion previously contained within the tubular container of the cigarette can be deformed from an original condition so as not to protrude longitudinally from the tubular container.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one arrangement, the filter portion is formed by a coil of thread encircling a longitudinally oriented axis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a cigarette comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">providing:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
<li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
<li id="ul0002-0001" num="0031">a sheet of paper for forming a tubular container of the cigarette;</li>
<li id="ul0002-0002" num="0032">a smoking medium to be consumed by smoking the cigarette; and</li>
<li id="ul0002-0003" num="0033">a longitudinally elongated holder for handling the cigarette;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">depositing the smoking medium on one side of the paper;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">locating the holder on said one side of the paper; and</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">once the smoking medium and the holder are disposed on said one side of the paper, rolling the paper transversely to the holder so as to form the tubular container receiving the smoking medium and the holder therein, the holder being oriented generally parallel to an axis of the tubular container.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">In one arrangement, the holder includes a longitudinally elongated gripping portion and a filter portion coupled thereto and extending longitudinally from a smoking medium side to a mouth side distal to the gripping portion relative to the smoking medium side of the filter portion, the filter portion being enlarged in a transverse direction relative to the gripping portion. In such an arrangement, rolling the paper to form the tubular container comprises shaping the tubular container to a diameter of the filter portion.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0045">The accompanying figures show an additive indicated at <b>10</b> for use in a smoking cigarette for smoking a smoking medium as well as the additive <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">Generally speaking, &#x2018;cigarette&#x2019; as used herein refers to a tubular container <b>1</b> receiving a smoking medium <b>3</b> such as a narcotic, herbs, or a medicated substance for smoking. The tubular container <b>1</b> is generally longitudinally elongated and is formed for example from a cylindrically-wrapped combustible paper, and typically the assembly of the container <b>1</b> and the smoking medium <b>3</b> collectively form the cigarette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">The additive <b>10</b> for consumption in the cigarette <b>5</b> comprises a non-flammable carrier <b>12</b> supporting thereon a body <b>14</b> of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> for consumption by smoking. The body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b> is supported on the non-flammable carrier <b>12</b> such that the carrier is embedded therein. The carrier thus defines a substrate of the additive <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">Thus the carrier <b>12</b> has an embedded support portion <b>16</b> which is covered and in contact with the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> and, furthermore, a gripping portion <b>18</b> which is connected to the support portion <b>16</b> and uncovered by the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> so as to be exposed, such that the gripping portion <b>18</b> protrudes from the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b> for handling the additive, such as to locate it within the tubular container <b>1</b> of the cigarette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">In the illustrated arrangements, the carrier <b>12</b> is a metallic thread which in an original condition extends linearly between opposite ends <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> of the thread or wire. Additionally, the carrier <b>12</b> is made from stainless steel which is generally considered a safe material for contacting a consumable substance, in this case formed by the <i>cannabis </i>extract oil. The material also dissipates thermal energy over a relatively short length.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">The carrier <b>12</b> is deformable so that, as the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil is removed from the carrier by combustion, the support portion <b>16</b> of the carrier previously covered by the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> can be deformed from the original condition so as not to obtrusively protrude from the cigarette. That is, as the tubular container <b>1</b>, the smoking medium <b>3</b> and the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> are consumed through combustion, the cigarette <b>5</b> becomes shorter in length, but since the carrier <b>12</b> is non-combustible it remains substantially in its original condition. Consequently, the carrier <b>12</b> eventually protrudes at the distal end of the cigarette, now being located externally of the tubular container <b>1</b> at the distal end to the user. As such, the now exposed portion of the carrier <b>12</b> which was previously covered by the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> can be deformed such as by bending back towards the user so that the carrier <b>12</b> is decreased in length to protrude to a lesser degree beyond the non-combusted, remaining portion tubular container <b>1</b> of the cigarette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">The illustrated arrangement of additive of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> further includes wrapping paper <b>24</b> such as of the parchment paper type that is removably covering the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b>. Typically the wrapping paper is not consumed during smoking and thus is removed, but prior to smoking when in use the paper <b>24</b> prevents the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil from sticking to foreign surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">The semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> comprises <i>cannabis </i>rosin which is formed by applying heat and pressure to a <i>cannabis </i>plant so as to extract therefrom the desired cannabinoids. For smoking, it is preferred that the <i>cannabis </i>extract oil to be consumed has higher levels of tetrahydrocannabinol which is one of the extractable cannabinoids. Even though <i>cannabis </i>rosin is free of residual chemicals or other contaminants as a nature of its formation process, the substance is not particularly suitable for handing as by simply placing in a user's hand the <i>cannabis </i>rosin tends to warm quickly and attain a very sticky sap like consistency. Furthermore, it does not wash off of skin easily without the use of a solvent like gasoline, and also it is likely not easily removed from clothing. As such, by providing the gripping portion <b>18</b> of the carrier, this allows the user to handle a small bare section of the additive, which is not coated in rosin, thereby eliminating the direct skin contact.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">In the illustrated arrangements, the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b> forms a substantially cylindrical body extending coaxially of the longitudinally elongated wire which defines the carrier <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">The semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> is disposed onto the carrier <b>12</b> by heating the semisolid oil to a suitable temperature at which it is pliable but remains in its semisolid state so that it can be formed onto the carrier <b>12</b>. The semisolid oil <b>15</b> is then allowed to cool so as to harden into the shaped body <b>14</b> formed on the carrier <b>12</b>. The semisolid oil <b>15</b> can be simultaneously heated by friction and manipulated into the desired shape by rolling a small quantity of the oil between separate pieces of non-stick parchment wrapping paper (so as to prevent contact with skin). Alternatively, the semisolid oil <b>15</b> can be heated so as to accept the carrier <b>12</b> as it is inserted therein, penetrating an outer surface of the body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055">In use, the additive <b>10</b> with the wrapping paper <b>24</b> removed from the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b> is inserted into the tubular container <b>1</b> of the cigarette in the interior space which is also occupied by the smoking medium <b>3</b>, which may be for example tobacco or dry ground <i>cannabis</i>. As a distal end of the cigarette is heated by an externally applied heat source, the tubular container <b>1</b>, the smoking medium <b>3</b>, and the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> are combusted and resultantly formed gas inhaled by the user at the cigarette's proximal end to the user's mouth. The carrier <b>12</b> is not combusted in this process and as the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> is removed therefrom by combustion, the protruding portion of the carrier can be bent so as to form a downward hook which the user can grab and use as a handle of the cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0056">The additive may be formed a machine or series of machines that can combine the process of metallic wire extrusion from a raw supply of metal such as stainless steel, and the process of heating/pressing <i>cannabis </i>to form <i>cannabis </i>rosin, and then combining or applying the rosin to the carrier or substrate defined by the wire. The heat generated from the extrusion process may be sufficient to warm the rosin for manipulation. The wire may be extruded and coated with the <i>cannabis </i>rosin and subsequently spooled for storage but prior to individual wrapping in the wrapping paper.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> show another arrangement of additive having a carrier <b>12</b>&#x2032; which further includes a filter portion <b>27</b> coupled to a support portion <b>16</b>&#x2032; of the carrier and which is located externally of the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b> so as not to be covered thereby. The filter portion <b>27</b> is thus provided opposite to the gripping portion <b>18</b>&#x2032;, and the support portion of the carrier is disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">The filter portion <b>27</b> extends longitudinally from a smoking medium side <b>29</b> thereof, which is disposed adjacent the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b>, to an opposite mouth side <b>30</b> of the filter portion <b>27</b>, which relative to the smoking medium side <b>29</b> is distal to the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>14</b> and to a first end <b>20</b> of the gripping portion <b>18</b>&#x2032;. As shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the filter portion <b>27</b> is enlarged in a transverse direction relative to both the support portion <b>16</b>&#x2032; and the gripping portion <b>18</b>&#x2032;, both of which in the illustrated arrangement are located transversely centrally of the filter portion <b>27</b> such that the filter portion <b>27</b> is radially enlarged relative thereto. That is, the filter portion <b>27</b> protrudes transversely outwardly relative to both the support and gripping portions <b>16</b>&#x2032;, <b>18</b>&#x2032; so as to define a stop surface <b>33</b> lying in a plane transverse to the longitudinal direction which resists movement of the smoking medium <b>3</b> longitudinally of the tubular container <b>1</b> in a direction towards the user's mouth which would be located at the end of the tubular container <b>1</b> adjacent to the filter portion <b>27</b>. This stop surface <b>33</b> is preferably defined circumferentially of the carrier <b>12</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">While resisting longitudinal movement of the smoking medium <b>3</b> towards the user's mouth by substantially obstructing the same, smoke from combustion of the smoking medium <b>3</b> can pass from the smoking medium side <b>29</b> of the filter portion <b>27</b> and to the mouth side <b>30</b> to be subsequently inhaled by the user through a passageway <b>35</b> which is defined by the filter portion <b>27</b> and which fluidically communicates the smoking medium side <b>29</b> and the mouth side <b>30</b> of the filter portion <b>27</b>. The passageway <b>35</b> extends longitudinally of the filter portion <b>27</b> and opens at each of the smoking medium side <b>29</b> and the mouth side <b>30</b> of the filter portion <b>27</b>. Thus the filter portion <b>27</b> of the illustrated arrangement is substantially tubular in shape. Furthermore, the passageway <b>35</b> is substantially free of smoking medium <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">In the illustrated arrangement, the filter portion <b>27</b> is formed by a coil of the metallic thread which defines the carrier <b>12</b>&#x2032; and which is non-flammable such that at the least the gripping and support portions <b>18</b>&#x2032;, <b>16</b>&#x2032; are non-flammable. The coil encircles a longitudinally oriented axis A which is the same longitudinal axis along which the support and gripping portions <b>16</b>&#x2032;, <b>18</b>&#x2032; lie. This longitudinal axis is oriented generally parallel to, and typically is disposed coaxially with, the axis of the tubular container <b>1</b> of the cigarette <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">It will be appreciated that the structure of the carrier <b>12</b>&#x2032;, as described with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, but provided free of the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil <b>15</b> may act as a holder for a smoking cigarette that is to be located within the tubular container <b>1</b> thereof. In such an arrangement, there is not considered to be a support portion as there is no semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil to carry, and therefore the filter portion is considered to be coupled to a second end of the gripping portion. Furthermore, the gripping and filter portions <b>16</b>&#x2032;, <b>27</b> of the holder are arranged to be located within the cigarette's tubular container <b>1</b> particularly as the whole of the holder is arranged to be located substantially inside the tubular container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">Thus, as the tubular container <b>1</b> is consumed during combustion of the cigarette, the internally located holder, with non-flammable gripping portion <b>18</b>&#x2032; and a filter portion <b>27</b> which also preferably is non-flammable as it is located within the tubular container <b>1</b> which is formed of flammable material, allows the user to handle the cigarette and also to provide a filter which acts to resist inhalation of the smoking medium <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">The gripping portion <b>18</b>&#x2032; is deformable relative to the longitudinal direction so that, as the smoking medium <b>3</b> is consumed, a portion of the gripping portion previously contained within the tubular container <b>1</b> of the cigarette <b>5</b> can be deformed from an original condition so as not to protrude longitudinally from the tubular container. For example, in such use the gripping portion would be bent downwardly so as to form a downwardly curving hook where the bottom of the hooked gripping portion is graspable by the user so as to hold the cigarette in a manner not conducive to burning the user's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">An outer surface <b>38</b> of the filter portion <b>27</b> of the holder around a full transverse periphery thereof is disposed in contact with an interior surface of the tubular container <b>1</b> so that the holder can support the cigarette <b>5</b> when the user is directly engaging only the gripping portion <b>18</b>&#x2032; without otherwise directly engaging the tubular container <b>1</b> so as to hold the same. Thus, when the tubular container <b>1</b> is formed by rolling a sheet of combustible cigarette paper, the same is rolled in a manner so that a cross-sectional shape of the tubular container particularly where it registers with the filter portion <b>27</b> conforms in size and shape thereto. Thus the holder is maintained in the tubular container substantially by friction fit as the holder is distinct and otherwise in removable contact from the tubular container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">As such, a cigarette incorporating the holder may be formed in the following manner, where a sheet of paper for forming the tubular container <b>1</b> of the cigarette, the smoking medium <b>3</b> to be consumed by smoking the cigarette, and the longitudinally elongated holder for handling the cigarette are provided:</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">depositing the smoking medium <b>3</b> on one side or surface area of the paper where the side is delimited by peripheral edges of the sheet of paper;</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">locating the holder <b>12</b>&#x2032; on the same side of the paper, and when the holder includes a gripping portion and a transversely enlarged filter portion then the holder is disposed on the paper such that the filter portion <b>27</b> is located to one side of the smoking medium <b>3</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">once the smoking medium <b>3</b> and the holder <b>12</b>&#x2032; are disposed on the same side of the paper, rolling the paper transversely to the holder <b>12</b>&#x2032; so as to form the tubular container <b>1</b> receiving the smoking medium <b>3</b> and the holder <b>12</b>&#x2032; therein, such that the holder is oriented generally parallel to an axis of the tubular container.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">It will be appreciated that if the smoking medium <b>3</b> is packed sufficiently densely then the rod-shaped carrier <b>12</b> without a transversely enlarged filter portion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, may serve to support the tubular container <b>1</b> as a holder.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">As described herein, the present invention relates in one aspect to an additive for a cigarette which is for smoking a smoking medium comprising a non-flammable carrier, a body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil for consumption by smoking that is supported on the carrier in a manner so as to leave a gripping portion of the carrier which is uncovered by the semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil such that the gripping portion protrudes from the body of semisolid <i>cannabis </i>extract oil for handling.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">Also as described herein, the present invention relates in another aspect to a holder for a cigarette that includes a non-flammable gripping portion for handling the cigarette and a transversely enlarged filter portion defining a fluidic passageway to enable combustion smoke to pass through the same, where both the gripping and filter portions are arranged to be located within the tubular container of the cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">Additionally as described herein, the present invention relates in yet another aspect to a method for forming a cigarette including an internally located holder that is distinct from the tubular container of the cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">The scope of the claims should not be limited by the preferred embodiments set forth in the examples but should be given the broadest interpretation consistent with the specification as a whole.</p>
